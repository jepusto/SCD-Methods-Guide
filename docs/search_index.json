Effect Size Estimation and Synthesis of Single-Case Designs: A Methods Guide. Institute of Education Sciences. U.S. Department of Education. Washington, DC. Retrieved from https://jepusto.github.io/SCD-Methods-Guide/ Preface We developed the Methods Guide to support educational researchers interested in estimating effect size measures and synthesizing findings from single-case design studies. To do so, we aim to do two things: (a) provide guidance and decision rules to simplify the process of selecting effect size estimation and synthesis methods and (b) illustrate the step-by-step application of appropriate methods using readily available tools. The guide is not meant to cover all effect size methods that have been proposed for single-case design studies, nor is it meant to summarize all of the research on effect size estimation and synthesis of single-case research. Rather, it is meant to provide easy-to-follow decision rules, along with step-by-step instructions and illustrations of user-friendly tools, so that researchers aiming to conduct a synthesis involving single-case studies are more readily able to do so. The guide is organized so that researchers can go immediately to the sections and chapters that are relevant to their immediate task, rather than having to read the guide sequentially from start to finish. The first chapter provides background and a flow chart (also shown below) to help researchers select among three broad approaches to synthesizing results from single-case research. Figure 0.1: Approaches to synthesizing findings from single-case research Those interested in synthesizing both single-case and group design studies should consider the design-comparable effect size approach and start by reading Chapter 2, which introduces this approach and its assumptions. They can then turn to one of the more detailed chapters providing step-by-step illustrations of how to estimate design comparable effect sizes with a user-friendly app (Chapter 3 if there are no trends, Chapter 4 if there are trends only in the treatment phases, or Chapter 5 if there are trends in both the baseline and treatment phases). Those interested in synthesizing single-case design studies that share a common outcome, and particularly if they are interested in examining changes in the effect over time, should consider the multilevel modeling approach and read Chapter 6, which introduces this approach and its assumptions. They can then turn to one of the more detailed chapters providing step-by-step instructions along with illustrations of how to estimate multilevel models to synthesize single-case data with a user-friendly app (Chapter 7 if there are no trends, or Chapter 8 if there are trends). Finally, those interested in synthesizing single-case design studies where the outcome measures vary across cases, and especially if they are interested in examining how the size of the effect varies from case to case, should consider the case-specific effect size approach. They can turn to Chapter 9, which introduces this approach and its assumptions, and Chapter 10, which provides step-by-step instructions along with illustration of how to estimate case-specific effect sizes with a user-friendly app. Datasets Acknowledgements We are grateful for the guidance from Katherine Taylor, who served as our project officer at the Institute of Education Sciences.

It also gives an overview of the three major approaches for estimation and synthesis of single-case studies: design-comparable effect sizes, case-specific effect sizes, and multilevel modeling of the raw individual participant interrupted time-series data. We describe the motivation and rationale for each of these approaches and provide a series of decision rules to guide researchers in selecting among them. The remaining chapters provide details and illustrations of the methods. 1.1 Background Educational decisions at the state, district, school, and student level are now expected to be informed by empirical evidence (“Council for Exceptional Children,” 2014; What Works Clearinghouse, 2020). These expectations create a major need for synthesis, or the integration of research findings from multiple, existing sources of evidence—including findings from single-case designs (SCDs). (Cooper, 2010; Pustejovsky &amp; Ferron, 2017)y developments in education related to the documentation of evidence-based practices. The first is the expanded use of SCD research methods across varying disciplines over the last 50 years, in both general and special education contexts (Kratochwill et al., 2013). Although the history of SCD methodology is beyond our present scope, innovations in design have expanded the use of SCDs across a range of professional fields, moving beyond SCD’s quasi-experimental and behavior analysis origins (see Kratochwill et al., 2013 for more detailed information on the history of SCD). Over the past 20 years, researchers’ commitment to using rigorous procedures to identify evidence-based educational practices affirms not only the importance of randomized control trials (RCTs), but the effectiveness and efficiency of SCD. The second development is the emergence of effect size (ES) measures and synthesis methods for use with SCD and other interrupted time series data (Shadish et al., 2015; Swaminathan et al., 2014). Interest in synthesis of SCDs is long-standing (e.g., Center et al., 1985; Gingerich, 1984; White, 1987), emerging around the same time as methods for meta-analysis of group designs were becoming more statistically rigorous and sophisticated (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985; Shadish &amp; Lecy, 2015). However, the past twenty years have seen increased intensity of methodological research focused on SCDs and a substantial expansion in the diversity, flexibility, and accessibility of available analytic methods upon which researchers can draw. We view the current state of methodology as falling into three strands: approaches that summarize the effect of each case and then synthesize these case-specific effect sizes (e.g., Pustejovsky, 2018), methods that use multi-level models for analyzing the raw (or standardized) data from one or multiple SCD studies (Van den Noortgate &amp; Onghena, 2008), and techniques that use design-comparable effect size metrics (Hedges et al., 2012, 2013; Pustejovsky et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2014; Swaminathan et al., 2014). The present guide is organized around these three broad methodological strands. The third development is the increased use of systematic review and meta-analysis procedures to identify and affirm evidence-based practices in education (Beretvas &amp; Chung, 2008; Shadish &amp; Rindskopf, 2007). Maggin and colleagues (2011) examined the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of SCDs from 1985 to 2009, finding a marked increase in the appearance of such reviews between 2000 and 2009. In another survey, Jamshidi and colleagues (2018) found increasing production through 2015, as well as improvements in the quality of published reviews. However, they also noted that, even in more recent literature, reviews often frequently failed to use appropriate methods for combining findings across studies (Jamshidi et al., 2018). Thus, there remains a need for guidance about how to select and apply methods for synthesizing findings from SCD research. Effect size (ES) measures are a critical companion to visual analysis for the interpretation of single-case research results, and are a key input in two of the available approaches for meta-analytic synthesis of SCDs. Although a variety of technically sound ES metrics exist for researchers to use when interpreting SCD findings, relatively few published meta-analyses use these more advanced techniques (cf. Barton et al., 2017; Jamshidi et al., 2018; Maggin et al., 2017). One reason for the lack of widespread use by researchers may be the conceptual and procedural complexity associated with advances in ES measures and meta-analysis techniques. A more rapid uptake of ES estimation methods may be hindered by the complexity of data extraction and calculation of ES for SCD. In addition, researchers may lack software tools for ES estimation for single-case studies when using some common statistical packages such as SPSS and SAS (Odom et al., 2018; Pustejovsky et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2015). 1.2 Purpose of the Methods Guide The purpose of this methods guide is to improve educational researchers’ practice in the estimation of ES measures and synthesis of findings from SCDs. We recognize that no single method is ideal for all research goals. Furthermore, methods that have the most to offer can be complex and may appear difficult to carry out. Thus, through the use of this methods guide, we aim to: (a) provide guidance and decision rules to simplify the process of selecting effect size estimation and synthesis methods and (b) illustrate the step-by-step application of appropriate methods using readily available tools, such as web-based software to calculate case-specific ES or design-comparable ES for SCD studies (e.g., Pustejovsky et al., 2021). 1.3 Study Quality Conducting a research synthesis (whether of group design studies, SCDs, or both) involves several stages, starting with formulating the research aims, specifying inclusion criteria, conducting a systematic search, and screening for eligible studies (Cooper, 2010; Pustejovsky &amp; Ferron, 2017). Additionally, before carrying out effect size calculations or meta-analysis, it is critical to consider the methodological quality and potential biases of studies to be included in the synthesis. To assist researchers in doing so, several distinct sets of standards are available for SCD studies (e.g., Kratochwill et al., 2013; Reichow et al., 2018; Tate et al., 2016; Zimmerman et al., 2018). After assessing methodological quality, researchers can use one of two strategies to guide the estimation and synthesis of effect sizes. One strategy incorporates consideration of study quality as an inclusion criteria, so that low-quality studies are screened out and synthesis is based on the subset of studies with quality high enough so that changes in outcome(s) can reasonably be attributed to the intervention. For example, the What Works Clearinghouse Single-Case Pilot Standards (Kratochwill et al., 2010) indicated that effect sizes are only to be computed after studies have been shown to meet both minimum design criteria (e.g., a multiple-baseline study has at least three temporally spaced opportunities for the effect to be demonstrated, along with phases of at least three observations) and minimum evidence criteria (e.g., visual analysis of the data from the study show experimental control so that the changes in the outcome can be attributed to the intervention). Concerns with estimating effect sizes for SCD studies without the use visual analysis to rule out alternative explanations for observed changes in the outcomes continues to be echoed in the literature (Kratochwill et al., 2021; Maggin et al., 2021). An alternative strategy in considering study quality is to use broader inclusion criteria, code for aspects study quality, and examine study quality codes as potential moderators in a meta-analysis. With this approach, researchers can estimate ESs for studies of varying degrees of quality and empirically explore whether the magnitude of ESs varies depending on aspects of study quality. We assume that researchers who use this methods guide will have already selected a method to assess study quality and an approach for incorporating those assessments into their synthesis. As such, we do not focus on SCD study quality assessment methods, but rather provide guidelines that can be applied to a collection of studies that have met the researchers’ inclusion criteria, which potentially include criteria related to study quality. Thus, in this guide we focus on the final stages of a research synthesis, on the questions of how to select a method for estimating effects, how to compute ES estimates (or otherwise prepare data for synthesis), and how to synthesize findings in the form of ES estimates or individual-level data. 1.4 Selecting an Approach for Effect Estimation and Synthesis In order to select an approach for estimating and synthesizing effects from SCDs, we recommend that researchers first reflect on the research aims that motivate their synthesis. In some contexts, researchers’ primary aims may be focused on summarizing evidence to arrive at statements about average efficacy of a class of interventions. In other contexts, researchers might instead or additionally be interested in understanding variation in effects and the extent to which such variation is associated with characteristics of participants, specific features of interventions, or other contextual factors. When the focus is mostly on summarization, researchers may find it more useful to use design-comparable effect sizes that describe average effects. If individual-level variation is the focus, then approaches using case-specific effect sizes or multi-level modeling may be more advantageous. Another over-arching consideration for selecting a synthesis approach pertains to the features of the studies identified for inclusion in the synthesis. Quantitative synthesis requires choosing an effect size metric that permits comparisons of the magnitude of effects across individual participants and studies. Consequently, the extent to which eligible studies use different types of designs or different types of outcome measurements creates constraints on how effects from those studies can be described or compared. For instance, if all eligible studies used multiple baseline designs across participants (or another common type of SCD), then several different synthesis approaches are feasible. In contrast, if eligible studies include both SCDs and group design studies (such as small randomized experiments, each with a single pre-test and a single post-test), then researchers need a synthesis approach that permits comparisons across both types of designs. Similarly, if all eligible studies used SCDs with very similar methods for assessing the dependent variable, then synthesis based on multi-level modeling of raw data is possible. In contrast, if eligible studies used a variety of different assessments, then a synthesis approach based on case-specific effect sizes may be required. These two broad considerations—the aims of the synthesis and the features of eligible studies—can guide the selection of an approach for synthesis of SCDs. We now describe in more detail how three broad approaches to synthesis fit within these considerations. 1.4.1 Design-Comparable Effect Sizes In some situations, the aim of the research team is to synthesize the evidence for intervention effectiveness from both single-case and group design studies. For example, a meta-analysis by Wood and colleagues (2018) analyzed 22 single-case and between-group studies to examine the effects of text-to-speech and other read-aloud tools on reading comprehension outcomes for students with reading disabilities. The authors used the standardized mean difference to estimate read-aloud intervention effects in the group design studies and a comparable standardized mean difference from the included single-case research, resulting in an overall average weighted effect size of \\(d\\) = 0.35, 95% CI (0.14, 0.56). Because the purpose of the Wood et al. (2018) study involved the comparison and averaging of effects across single-case and group designs, it was critical to use an ES metric that is theoretically comparable across the designs. In similar situations, researchers should select from the design-comparable effect size options (Hedges et al., 2012, 2013; Pustejovsky et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2014; Swaminathan et al., 2014; Van den Noortgate &amp; Onghena, 2008). However, if researchers aim to synthesize findings from only single-case studies (i.e., not to integrate findings across single-case and group design studies), other options may be preferable. 1.4.2 Case-Specific Effect Sizes In addition to summarizing average effects across studies, researchers may also be interested in exploring variation in treatment effects across individual participants. When dependent variables are measured differently across studies, it is important for researchers to use an effect size metric and synthesis approach that accounts for such. For example, Bowman-Perrott and colleagues (2016) examined five potential moderators of the effectiveness of the Good Behavior Game in promoting positive behavior in the classroom. Results of their meta-analysis suggested that the intervention was most effective in reducing problem behaviors among students with or at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders. Another meta-analysis by Mason and colleagues (2016) investigated the moderating effects of participant characteristics, targeted outcomes, and implementation components on the efficacy of video self-modeling, in which a learner with disabilities watches a video of a model engaged in targeted skills or tasks. They found that intervention effects were stronger for younger participants with autism-spectrum disorders. Because these syntheses focused on investigating variation across individuals in the effect of treatment, it was important that the effect size estimation and synthesis approach produced effect estimates for each individual participant, rather than a study-level summary effect estimates. In addition, because the outcome measure differed among studies, the researchers needed an individual-level effect size metric that is not scale-dependent (e.g., they could not be based on simple raw score mean differences). In contexts like these, researchers should consider selecting among the case-specific effect size estimation and synthesis options. The case-specific effect size options are not viable for synthesis across single-case and group design studies because the case-specific effects are not comparable to the group design effects. However, the design-comparable effects are not viable for studying within-participant variation between individuals in treatment effectiveness because they produce effect estimates at the study level (i.e., the effect averaged across the cases), not the individual level. 1.4.3 Multilevel Modeling of Individual Participant Interrupted Time-Series Data Finally, researchers might have identified a set of SCDs that all use the same or very similar outcome measures, with the aim of studying the variation in effects over time within and between individuals. For example, Datchuk and colleagues (Datchuk et al., 2020) meta-analyzed 15 single-case studies with 79 students to examine the effects of an intervention on the level and trend in correct writing sequences per minute for students with disabilities. They found the effect increased with time in intervention (i.e., there was a positive effect on the trend) and that this temporal change in effect was more pronounced with younger students. When focusing on both variation in effect over time and variation in effect across cases, it is important that the researchers select a meta-analytic approach that does not rely only on a single effect estimate for a study (e.g., design-comparable effect sizes) or even a single effect estimate for a case (e.g., case-specific effect sizes). In contexts like this, we suggest researchers consider options for multilevel modeling of individual participant data series. 1.4.4 Summary of Options for Effect Estimation and Synthesis The flow chart in Figure 1.1 illustrates a set of heuristic decision rules for selecting among the three general approaches to estimating and synthesizing single-case research. If the primary purpose of one’s research is to integrate findings from both single-case and group-design studies, the researcher should consider design-comparable effect sizes. Alternately, if the primary purpose of the research is to integrate findings from SCDs only, additional questions should be addressed related to the measurement of the dependent variable. If the outcome of interest is measured in different ways for different cases and the researcher aims to examine how effects vary across the cases, then the researcher should consider the options for estimating and synthesizing case-specific effect sizes. If the outcome is measured the same way across cases, and there is interest in how the effect changes over the course of an intervention, the researcher should consider multilevel modeling of the raw data series. Figure 1.1: Flow chart showing the approach for synthesizing effect evidence based on the types of studies being examined and whether the outcome variable is common across cases. 1.4.5 Limitations in Selecting an Approach for Effect Estimation and Synthesis We emphasize that Figure 1.1 presents a heuristic, simplified procedure for the selection among the three general approaches to ES estimation and synthesis, which does cover every possible research context. There will surely be situations where researchers’ aims and contexts differ from those we describe, and thus do not align perfectly with one of our primary approaches to estimating and synthesizing single-case effect sizes. For example, researchers who are synthesizing findings from a set of SCDs may wish to compare their results to a previously published meta-analysis of group design studies, but not to investigate individual-level variation in treatment effects. They may therefore elect to use design-comparable effect sizes even though they are not formally integrating results from group design studies within their review. A further possibility is that researchers might elect to use multiple approaches to synthesis in order to address different aims or questions. For example, consider a project in which researchers have identified both single-case and group design studies. They might want to integrate findings across design types while also exploring the variation in effects among individuals. In this scenario, researchers could estimate design-comparable effect sizes for their first aim and case-specific effect sizes from the subset of single-case studies for their second aim. We also note that there may be situations that falls in between those we described for case-specific effect sizes and those for multilevel modeling of the raw data series. For example, researchers may want to examine how effects vary over time and across cases, using studies with different outcomes. For this purpose, the researchers can use extensions of the primary approaches we present. The researchers could either standardize the raw data before estimating a multilevel model, or they could synthesize case specific effect sizes where they use multiple standardized effects for each case (e.g., an effect that indexes the immediate shift in level, and another effect that indexes a change in slope). Our simplified selection method cannot exhaustively cover all currently available options. Finally, we anticipate that the heuristic guidance we provide here will need to be refined over time, as further methodological innovations become available. We anticipate that research presently underway will provide even more meta-analytic options in the future, with implications for how to select an approach for synthesis. At some point it may be possible to compute case-specific effect sizes that are also design-comparable, or it may be possible to standardize the data for multilevel models in a way that leads to parameter estimates from the model that correspond to design-comparable effect estimates. If such methods become available, some of the distinctions made here will become artificial. In the time, remainder of this methods guide follows the proposed heuristics for selecting among the three major approaches to effect size estimation and synthesis. Even as methodology continues to advance, researchers need guidance that acknowledges the complexity of research purposes and contexts and is dynamic in its accommodation of such variation, while also being concrete and straightforward enough to be put into practice. 1.5 Structure of the Methods Guide We divide the remainder of this guide into three major sections: design-comparable effect size estimation and synthesis, case-specific effect size estimation and synthesis, and multilevel modeling to estimate and synthesize effects. These sections do not build upon each other or need to be read in order. Rather, we expect those using this guide to follow the decision rules in Figure 1.1 to determine which section of the guide is most appropriate for them, and then to jump immediately to that section. Each major section is divided into chapters. The initial chapter of each section introduces the specific approach and its assumptions, discusses when to use it, and what options exist within the approach. Furthermore, we provide additional decision rules for selecting among the specific techniques and options available with a given broad approach. We encourage researchers to use the decision rules within the initial chapter of the major section to get to an appropriate option. Then, researchers can directly refer to the chapter that has the illustration for that specific option. For each illustration, we: describe the purposes for estimating and synthesizing effects, and the available data, demonstrate how to use the decision rules in Figure 1.1, along with the additional decision rules within the initial chapter of the major section, to arrive at the option being illustrated, present the data for the illustration showing how it needs to be structured for the analysis, and provide a step-by-step illustration of how to estimate and synthesize effects using readily available analysis tools.

We highlight both the assumptions for using design-comparable effect sizes in meta-analytic synthesis and the assumptions for estimation of these effect sizes from primary study data. We then describe available options for estimating design-comparable effect sizes. These options allow for different assumptions regarding trends in baseline or treatment phases and different assumptions about the variation in the treatment effect across cases. This chapter concludes with a set of decision rules for selecting among the options for design-comparable effect sizes. 2.1 Background Design-comparable effect sizes are effect size indices for single case studies that are on the same metric as effect size indices used in group comparison studies (Hedges et al., 2012, 2013; Pustejovsky et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2014; Swaminathan et al., 2014; Van den Noortgate &amp; Onghena, 2008). These design-comparable effect sizes are valuable in a variety of synthesis contexts, particularly those that involve both single-case design (SCD) and group comparison studies. However, these methods also have several limitations. First, design-comparable effect sizes rely on an estimate of the variance between participants, requiring at least three distinct participants for estimation. This constrains their use to SCDs involving multiple participants (e.g., multiple baseline design across participants) or close replications of SCDs, each of which has a single participant (e.g., ABAB design replicated across several students). Further, existing research on design-comparable effect size methods is only available for multiple baseline, multiple probe, or replicated treatment reversal designs. Researchers have yet to develop extensions for alternating treatment designs and other types of SCDs. However, ongoing research is likely to increase the designs for which design-comparable effect sizes can be estimated. A second conceptual limitation is that design-comparable effect sizes produce a single summary effect size per outcome–which represents an average effect across participants–just as between-group design study effect sizes are summaries of average effects across participants. As a result, the design-comparable effect size might conceal heterogeneity of effects across participants in an SCD. Meta-analytic researchers are then limited to moderator analyses focused on study-level characteristics; it is not feasible to examine potential moderators that vary across cases in a study or across time points within a case. A third limitation is that design-comparable effect sizes are based on a hierarchical model that involves specific assumptions about the distribution of outcomes measured in the study. Developing a reasonable model requires care and attention to the plausibility of its assumptions. It is not a trivial or automatic process (as effect size calculations for between-group experimental designs are sometimes treated). Moreover, for some types of outcomes, the distributional assumptions of the model may be inappropriate, which further limits the applicability of the design-comparable effect size. To address these methodological limitations, we use this chapter to provide researchers with guidance on the selection and use of design-comparable effect size estimates. We describe six of the most common modeling options and provide guidance on how to select among these options when calculating design-comparable effect size for use in a research synthesis. 2.2 When to Use Design-Comparable Effect Sizes When choosing an effect size for single-case design data, researchers should begin by considering the broader purpose for computing effect sizes. In some cases, researchers may want to synthesize results across different types of studies, as in a comprehensive synthesis of all studies conducted on a topic. For example, researchers conducting a meta-analysis might include all studies examining the effects of social skills interventions on the social and academic outcomes of elementary-aged students with disabilities. In some areas of education research, it is likely that the literature identified for synthesis includes both group and single-case experimental studies. To average the effect across studies with different designs, researchers must pick an effect size index that has a comparable interpretation for each of the included designs (Hedges et al., 2012, 2013; Pustejovsky et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2015). For exactly this purpose, methodologists developed the design-comparable effect size for SCDs, providing an effect size on a common metric by answering the question, “What would the standardized mean difference effect size be if one could somehow perform a between-group randomized experiment based on the same population of participants, intervention protocol, and outcome measures?” 2.3 General Definition of Design-Comparable Effect Sizes To understand the logic of the design-comparable effect size, it is helpful to consider how effect sizes are defined in group design studies. In a between-groups randomized experiment comparing a treatment condition (Tx) to a control condition (C) for a specified population, researchers commonly summarize results using the standardized mean difference effect size index. In Equation (2.1), we define this effect size parameter as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.1} \\delta = \\frac{\\mu_{Tx} - \\mu_C}{\\sigma_C}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mu_{Tx}\\) is the average outcome if the entire population received the treatment condition, \\(\\mu_C\\) is the average outcome if the entire population received the control condition, and \\(\\sigma_C\\) is the standard deviation of the outcome if the entire population received the control condition. The effect size may be estimated by substituting sample means and sample standard deviations in place of the corresponding population quantities (Borenstein, 2009), or by pooling sample standard deviations across the intervention and control conditions under the assumption that the population variance is equal. Alternately, the mean difference in the numerator of the effect size can be estimated based on a statistical model, such as an analysis of covariance that adjusts for between-group differences in baseline characteristics (Taylor et al., 2022). Researchers often apply the Hedges \\(g\\) small-sample correction, which reduces the bias of the effect size estimator that arises from estimating \\(\\sigma_C\\) based on a limited number of observations (Hedges, 1981). Using data from a multiple baseline, multiple probe, or replicated treatment reversal design, the design-comparable effect size for SCDs aims to estimate the same quantity as the standardized mean difference from a between-groups experiment. This task poses challenges because the data from such SCDs involve repeated measurements taken over time. To precisely define the design-comparable effect size, researchers must therefore be specific about the timing of both intervention implementation and outcome assessment. Hypothetically, if a between-groups experiment uses the same study procedures as the SCD, researchers would still need to determine and specify when to begin intervention and when to collect outcome data. Furthering this example, suppose that the SCD takes place over times \\(t=1,...,T\\). In our hypothetical between-groups experiment, intervention starts at time \\(A\\) for \\(1 \\leq A &lt; T\\) and collection of outcome data for all participants occurs at time \\(B\\) for \\(A &lt; B\\). The standardized mean difference from such an experiment would contrast the average outcome at time \\(B\\) if the entire population had started intervention at time \\(A\\) [i.e., \\(\\mu_B(A)\\)] to the average outcome at time \\(B\\) if the entire population had remained in baseline through time \\(B\\) and then started intervention later at time \\(T\\) [i.e., \\(\\mu_B(T)\\)]. The standardized mean difference would then correspond to \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.2} \\delta_{AB} = \\frac{\\mu_B(A) - \\mu_B(T)}{\\sigma_B(T)}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mu_B(A)\\) is the average outcome at follow-up time \\(B\\) if the entire population were to receive the intervention at time \\(A\\). Then, \\(\\mu_B(T)\\) is the average outcome at follow-up time \\(B\\) if the entire population were to receive the intervention at time \\(T\\). Finally, \\(\\sigma_B(T)\\) is the standard deviation of the outcome at follow-up time \\(B\\) if the entire population were to receive the intervention at time \\(T\\). Note that \\(\\mu_B(T)\\) corresponds to the average outcome under the control condition (\\(\\mu_C\\), above), because participants would not yet have received intervention as of time \\(B\\). Similarly \\(\\sigma_B(T)\\) is the analogue of \\(\\sigma_C\\), the standard deviation of the outcome under the control condition because participants would not yet have received the intervention as of time \\(B\\). Pustejovsky et al. (2014) described a strategy for estimating \\(\\delta_AB\\) using data from an SCD study. Broadly, the strategy involves specifying a multilevel model for the data, estimating the component quantities \\(\\mu_B(A)\\), \\(\\mu_B(T)\\), and \\(\\sigma_B(T)\\) based on the specified model, and applying a small-sample correction analogous to Hedges \\(g\\). However, because of the need to estimate the standard deviation of the outcome across the participant population [\\(\\sigma_B(T)\\)], this strategy only works if the SCD study includes data from multiple participants. The approach involves a multilevel model for the data because SCDs involve repeated measurements collected for each of several participants. The first level of the model describes the pattern of repeated measurements over time nested within a given participant and the second level of the model describes how the first-level parameters vary across participants. As a result, the model involves deconstructing \\(\\sigma_B(T)\\) into two components: within-participant variation and between-participant variation. This process is not typically possible in a between-groups randomized experiment unless researchers collect repeated outcome measures for each participant. 2.4 What We Assume When We Synthesize Design-Comparable Effect Sizes The motivation for using the design-comparable effect size δ from SCD studies is strongest when researchers intend to synthesize SCD and group design studies in the same meta-analysis. If assumptions needed for synthesis are not reasonably met, it may be more appropriate to analyze the SCD and group design studies separately. Then, researchers may want to consider alternative effect size metrics for the SCD studies. For this reason, this chapter presents the broader synthesis assumptions prior to the specific assumptions needed for estimating design-comparable effect sizes. The random effects model is the predominant statistical model for synthesizing effect sizes across studies. With this statistical model, we do not assume that the population effect size estimated in one study is identical to the population effect size estimated from another study. Rather, we assume that the effect size estimated for Study \\(j\\) may differ from the effect size estimated for Study \\(k\\) (e.g., \\(\\sigma_j \\ne \\sigma_k\\)). There are several general frameworks for explaining why the effect size may vary from one study to the next. One such framework posits that differences can arise from variation across studies in the units, treatments, observing operations, and settings [UTOS; Becker (1996)]. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the meta-analysis can be set up to constrain (but not completely eliminate) the variation from study to study on these dimensions. Use of a random effects model for the summary meta-analysis and the exploration of moderators of the treatment effects is warranted because some degree of variation in effects is anticipated. There are several different ways to understand the assumptions underlying the random effects model. One way is to imagine that the included studies in a synthesis represent a random sample from a super-population of possible studies on the topic of interest. In a Bayesian framework, the model can also be motivated by the assumption of exchangeability, meaning that the effect size of studies included in a synthesis are on a common metric that permits judgements of similarity and that their relative magnitude cannot be systematically predicted a priori (Higgins et al., 2009). For brevity, we refer to both suppositions (i.e., the super-population and Bayesian motivations) as the exchangeability assumption. Crucially, the exchangeability assumption depends on the effect size metric used for synthesis; for a given set of studies, the assumption may be reasonable for one effect size metric but unreasonable for another. Thus far, we have defined the standardized mean difference metric (\\(\\delta\\)) for design-comparable effect sizes for SCDs. Therefore, we now consider the exchangeability of \\(\\delta s\\). When intending to synthesize a set of studies where there is considerable variation among the study outcomes, sampled units, or treatments (i.e., they differ greatly from one another on one or more of these UTOS characteristics), then the \\(\\delta s\\) from these studies are likely not exchangeable. In contrast, when there is similarity in the UTOS, exchangeability is more reasonable. As an example, for the standardized mean difference metric, exchangeability is more plausible when one study’s population of participants closely mirrors the participant population characteristics from another study (i.e., similar, if not same, inclusion criteria). Further, when the populations are similar and studies use the exact same operational measure of the dependent variable, we can assume that the distribution of outcomes in the control condition has similar variance. Alternatively, if the two studies drew from populations with very different characteristics so that the disbursement of the study results (distribution of the dependent variable) varied widely, an intervention that produces identical effects on the scale of the dependent variable would have quite different effect sizes on the scale of the standardized mean difference. When populations are distinctly different, the exchangeability assumption is less tenable. Thus, we encourage researchers to examine the studies they plan to include in their synthesis for the potential lack of exchangeability. Researchers can explore this aspect of the exchangeability assumption by examining the sampling methods and measurement procedures of the included studies. When subsets of studies use the same operational measure of the dependent variable, the between-participant (case) variance in those studies can be compared. To illustrate the exploration of between-case variability, consider the sampling procedures used in the following two studies extracted from Datchuk et al. (2020) that examined the effect of interventions on writing performance as measured by correct word sequences (CWS). In one study, the sample consisted of three 7-year-old White males identified by their teachers as struggling with writing (Parker et al., 2012). In the other study (Stotz et al., 2008), the sample comprised three 10-year-old students who exhibited poor writing skills. The first student was a Black male identified with an emotional disturbance, the second student was a White male identified with a specific learning disability, and the third student was a White female identified with a specific learning disability. Presented with this information, we then seek to answer the following questions: (a) Are these samples similar enough to satisfy the exchangeability assumption with the standardized mean difference metric? (b) Might the second sample with variation in differences in participant characteristics (age, race, gender, and educational disability category), be so much more variable in writing performance that it is not reasonable to use the standardized mean difference metric to judge similarity of effects across both studies? In the first study (Parker et al., 2012), the mean number of CWS during baseline for the three participants were \\(8.29\\), \\(15.0\\), and \\(10.8\\). In the second study (Stotz et al., 2008), participants’ mean CWS baseline levels were \\(14.6\\), \\(29.1\\), and \\(22.1\\). In Study 1, the between-case variation, as indexed by the standard deviation (SD) of the three baseline means, is \\(3.4\\), whereas the between-case SD is \\(7.3\\) in Study 2. Now we must consider whether this difference is large enough to distort the design-comparable effect size. To address our questions, we first consider the raw score effect size for each study by specifying a multilevel model that assumes no trends in baseline or treatment phases, and variation in the effect across cases. In Study 1, the shift in the expected number of CWS when moving from baseline to intervention, or raw score effect size, is \\(10.7\\). In Study 2, the CWS raw score effect size is \\(9.6\\), about 1.1 times smaller than the raw score effect size for Study 1. Next, we consider the design-comparable effect size computed using the same model used for the raw score effect size. The design-comparable effect size is \\(0.962\\) for Study 1 and \\(0.827\\) for Study 2; the effect size for Study 1 is approximately 1.2 times greater than Study 2, like the ratio of the observed raw score effect sizes. We anticipate that future research will provide guidance regarding how much difference in sampling (and resulting between-case variability) researchers can accommodate without creating notable problems for the synthesis of design-comparable effect sizes. Similarly, researchers will continue to investigate, and hopefully establish consensus about, the degree to which differences among outcomes and treatments between studies are tolerable to have confidence in their effect size results. Until then, we suggest that meta-analysts be aware of the underlying exchangeability assumption (that the effect sizes expressed on a given metric are exchangeable across studies) and be forthright and transparent about their findings when reporting results of their synthesis. If the differences in the units, treatments, observing operations, and settings between the SCD studies and the group studies are much larger than the differences among either the SCD or group studies, it may be preferable to meta-analyze the SCD and group studies separately. Conversely, if the differences are negligible from one set of studies to the next, the exchangeability assumption is more tenable, and attention can be turned to the assumptions necessary to estimate the design-comparable effect size. 2.4.1 What We Assume When We Estimate Design-Comparable Effect Size Design-comparable effect sizes for SCD studies rely on multilevel models. Estimation is based on several key assumptions, including distributional assumptions about the errors. The models assume that observations for each case are normally distributed around the case-specific trend line, and the variation of observations around the trend line is homogeneous from one phase to the next and from one case to the next. In addition, there are assumptions about the underlying structural model, including whether there are trends in phases. Below, we explain these assumptions in greater detail and provide exemplars of each. 2.4.2 Normality Use of design-comparable effect sizes assumes that the experimental observations are normally distributed around the case-specific trend lines. The data may be consistent with this assumption of normality, but not always. For example, Ota &amp; DuPaul (2002) utilized a multiple baseline design across three participants to examine the effects of a math software intervention with a game component on the off-task behaviors of students with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To examine the normality assumption, we extracted the study data using Webplot Digitizer (Rohatgi, 2015) and present it in Figure 2.1. When examining the baseline phases, observations appear to be distributed somewhat normally around the baseline means, with a pooled skewness value near zero (\\(sk = 0.15\\)) and a pooled kurtosis value near zero (\\(ku = -0.77\\)). However, we observe non-normality in the treatment phases because the outcome is a percentage that has remained near the floor of 0% for much of the treatment phase (\\(sk = 1.86\\); \\(ku = 4.99\\)). Figure 2.1: Multiple baseline design across three participants (Ota &amp; DuPaul, 2002) With count-based variables, we often anticipate some departures from the traditional normality assumption. These departures tend to be more pronounced when a count variable has a phase mean close to zero. Departures from the traditional normality assumption are more pronounced when a percentage variable has a phase mean close to either end of the \\(0\\%-100\\%\\) range. These situations are common in published SCDs because the quality of an SCD study is often judged on the stability and level of observations in baseline and treatment phases. For example, if researchers design an intervention to increase a non-reversible behavior (e.g., academic skill), it would be ideal to only recruit participants without the target skill in their repertoire so that observations in the baseline phase reflect such-they would have baseline observations at or near 0. Conversely, an SCD recommendation for behavior-reduction interventions is to seek low rates or non-occurrence of the target behavior in the treatment phase, communicating that the intervention effectively led to the amelioration or extinction of a problem behavior. However, distributions may more closely align with the normality assumption when treatment phase counts are higher than 0, or the percentage variable has a mean closer to \\(50\\%\\). Available evidence indicates that design-comparable effect sizes can tolerate a moderate degree of non-normality for relatively simple model specifications (Chen et al., 2023). However, additional research is needed to determine how much non-normality can be present before there are substantial consequences for the design-comparable effect size. 2.4.3 Homogeneity of Variance In addition to assuming normality, the illustrations of design-comparable effect size estimation provided in this guide all assume that the within-case variation is homogeneous across phases and cases within a study. Although assumptions of homogeneity across cases and phases may be reasonable, there are situations when researchers should not assume homogeneity of variance. Consider again the Ota &amp; DuPaul (2002) study, with the multiple baseline design graphs in Figure 2.1. Results of our visual analysis suggest that the variance differs between the baseline and treatment phases, with less variation in the treatment phase as the percentage of off-task behaviors decreased and approached 0 (i.e., extinction). With count-based variables (e.g., raw counts or counts converted to percentages), variability often depends on the variable mean. Thus, treatments that shift the mean tend to change the variance. If studies have unstructured baselines, substantial variability is common. If there is tight experimental control in the intervention phase (e.g., researchers predict and control for interventionist/peer attention, strong treatment fidelity), we might expect some reduction in variance. With studies like these, where the variance differs between the baseline and treatment phases, we recommend estimating a more complex multilevel model that yields separate variance estimates for the two phases rather than assuming homogeneity across phases. Such models are feasible to estimate using the tools presented in subsequent chapters, but are beyond the scope of the guide. Until future research provides more concrete guidance about the best ways to proceed when encountering between-case heterogeneity, meta-analysts must remain aware of their assumptions and transparent about analytic decisions when reporting methods and results. Upon discovering substantial violations to the normality or homogeneity assumptions, we encourage researchers to consider whether violations to the exchangeability assumption needed for synthesis are also present. For example, imagine that meta-analysts interested in synthesizing the effects of oral narrative interventions select a multiple baseline design study that has all cases reporting baseline observations consistently at or near 0. It is likely that both the normality and homogeneity assumptions are violated for this study. It is also likely that the outcome used in the hypothetical study differs greatly from the outcomes used in the included group design studies. This leads to questions about the exchangeability of the effect sizes. In such circumstances, we advise against trying to force the computation of a design-comparable effect size and the synthesis of SCD and group design studies together. A more appropriate synthesis option may be to meta-analyze the SCD and group design studies separately, allowing for the use of a more appropriate effect size metric for the SCD studies separate from that used for the group design studies. However, we expect that normality and homogeneity of variance assumption violations will often be more modest (or non-existent) than in the above example, so that researchers can continue to entertain the use of the design-comparable effect size. 2.4.4 Appropriate Structural Model The estimation of design-comparable effect sizes requires assumptions about the structural model for the data series collected in the SCD. Ideally, these assumptions are based on content expertise, knowledge of the intervention domain, and understanding of the dependent variable(s) under review. The assumptions also rely on visual analysis and calculation of descriptive statistics from the studies. Regarding baseline trend, given our knowledge and understanding of the behavior(s), context(s), and participants included in the studies, we can assume one of three things: no trend in baseline, a linear trend in baseline, or some form of nonlinear trend. Similarly, we can use the same knowledge to make assumptions about data trends in the treatment phase: no trend, linear trend, or nonlinear trend. Furthermore, we can make assumptions about the parameters defining the baseline trajectory (e.g., level and slope) and the change in trajectory with treatment (e.g., the change in level and change in slope)–they either differ across cases within the study, or we can assume that some of these parameters are the same across cases. Purposeful consideration of our included SCDs is likely to lead to more accurate effect size estimation. If we do not select a structural model consistent with our data, we can expect biased design-comparable effect size estimates. Figure 2.2: Multiple Baseline Across Participants (Rodgers et al., 2020) As an example, we present the study of a writing intervention for post-secondary adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities that targeted the improvement of sentence construction (Rodgers et al., 2021). Figure 2.2 is a graphical depiction of the study design and outcome data. Visual analysis of the baseline phases suggests potential baseline trends in accurate writing sequences. Therefore, it would be appropriate to specify a model that assumes a trend in baseline. For participant Denny, our visual analysis of observed correct writing sequences suggests an increasing baseline trend, represented by the solid line in Figure 2.3 (estimated using ordinary least squares regression). In contrast, if we selected a baseline model assuming no trend, Denny’s projected baseline of no trend is considerably different than the projected baseline assuming a linear trend. (In Figure 2.3, note the difference between the dotted lines representing the baseline trends projected through the treatment phase). The effect estimate would be larger if we did not model the baseline trend in Figure 2.3 because the observed treatment values are further above the projection based on no trend than the projection based on trend. Thus, assumptions about trends have consequences for the effect size estimates. Figure 2.3: Hypothesized and Projected Baselines for Denny (Rodgers et al., 2020) To select an appropriate structural model, we recommend that meta-analysts start by carefully considering the discipline or intervention under study for the research synthesis, including but not limited to the outcome of interest, the participants included in the studies, and what prior research says about what can be expected regarding trends in absence of intervention and data trends in the treatment phase. For example, a review of research on the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS) over time show some efficacy in the reduction of both in-school and out-of-school student suspensions for Black students and students with disabilities (see Gage et al., 2020 for a review). Using this as a basis for understanding the nature of the interventions, contexts, and populations, we can reasonably assume future PBIS research would report similar responses to the interventions if the research contexts are similar. However, rather than make such a broad assumption without verifying it, we recommend that meta-analysts visually analyze all data for studies included in the synthesis and consider the degree to which the data from the studies are reasonably consistent with prior expectations. If data from the studies are consistent with trend expectations (e.g., a learning curve associated with the development of a new skill), these assumptions can be used to select among the design-comparable effect size modeling options. Misalignment between a priori assumptions and actual observations across the studies’ included data is likely to compromise the degree of confidence that we place in estimating effect sizes. If substantial inconsistencies exist between researchers’ expectations for and actual observations of study data, results from any single modeling option become more suspect. In these situations, we encourage researchers to estimate the effects for each of the competing sets of trend assumptions to provide information on the sensitivity of the findings to the modeling decisions. 2.5 Modeling Options for Design-comparable Effect Size Estimation After meta-analysts consider the tenability of the exchangeability assumption, we suggest consideration of normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions. If violations to these distributional assumptions are severe, researchers should reconsider whether the SCD and group design study outcomes are similar enough to assume exchangeability and warrant synthesis using the standardized mean difference effect size metric. If outcomes are substantially different across design types, it may be more reasonable to meta-analyze the SCD and group design studies separately and to use a different effect size metric for the SCD studies. When outcomes appear more similar and violations are not too severe, we suggest meta-analysts proceed with the design-comparable effect sizes and note findings. In their decision to proceed with design-comparable effect sizes, researchers should describe the range of characteristics of the SCD as well as the predominant SCD used in the area of synthesis. For example, do most SCD studies in the research area tend to use reversal designs (e.g., ABAB designs) or do studies predominantly use designs of multiple baseline and/or multiple probe across participants? When synthesizing reversal designs with design-comparable effect sizes, researchers are currently limited to models that assume stability (i.e., no trend). For multiple baseline or multiple probe designs, a variety of trend assumptions are feasible such as linear or quadratic. When the synthesis includes predominantly multiple baseline and/or multiple probe designs, researchers should state their expectations about trends given their understanding of the participants, context, and outcome under study. We also recommend they visually inspect the graphs of the data from the primary studies, analyzing them for consistency with the trend expectations. Based on these considerations, it is helpful to determine which of the following sets of trend assumptions are most reasonable for the set of studies to be synthesized: (a) no trends in baseline or treatment phases, (b) no trends in baseline, but trends in treatment phases, or (c) trends in baseline and differential trends in treatment. After clarifying the trend assumptions, researchers next need to clarify assumptions about variability in treatment effect across cases (e.g., Is the treatment effect expected to be the same for each case or are between-participant differences anticipated in the response to intervention?). Again, we rely heavily on logic models for the area of research and visual analyses of primary study data to determine if these data are reasonably consistent with the expectations. Figure 2.4 arranges these considerations into a series of decision rules that researchers can use to select from one of six common models for design-comparable effect sizes. Although there are other possibilities for specifying a design-comparable effect size estimation model, these six models cover a wide range of scenarios that can be estimated with the scdhlm software application (Pustejovsky et al., 2021). In addition, we included models that have received the most attention in the methodological literature, as well as those that have been applied in meta-analyses of single-case data.
