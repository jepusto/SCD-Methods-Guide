Retrieved from https://jepusto.github.io/SCD-Methods-Guide/ Preface We developed the Methods Guide to support educational researchers interested in estimating effect size measures and synthesizing findings from single-case design studies. To do so, we aim to do two things: (a) provide guidance and decision rules to simplify the process of selecting effect size estimation and synthesis methods and (b) illustrate the step-by-step application of appropriate methods using readily available tools. The guide is not meant to cover all effect size methods that have been proposed for single-case design studies, nor is it meant to summarize all of the research on effect size estimation and synthesis of single-case research. Rather, it is meant to provide easy-to-follow decision rules, along with step-by-step instructions and illustrations of user-friendly tools, so that researchers aiming to conduct a synthesis involving single-case studies are more readily able to do so. The guide is organized so that researchers can go immediately to the sections and chapters that are relevant to their immediate task, rather than having to read the guide sequentially from start to finish. The first chapter provides background and a flow chart (also shown below) to help researchers select among three broad approaches to synthesizing results from single-case research. Figure 0.1: Approaches to synthesizing findings from single-case research Those interested in synthesizing both single-case and group design studies should consider the design-comparable effect size approach and start by reading Chapter 2, which introduces this approach and its assumptions. They can then turn to one of the more detailed chapters providing step-by-step illustrations of how to estimate design comparable effect sizes with a user-friendly app (Chapter 3 if there are no trends, Chapter 4 if there are trends only in the treatment phases, or Chapter 5 if there are trends in both the baseline and treatment phases). Those interested in synthesizing single-case design studies that share a common outcome, and particularly if they are interested in examining changes in the effect over time, should consider the multilevel modeling approach and read Chapter 6, which introduces this approach and its assumptions. They can then turn to one of the more detailed chapters providing step-by-step instructions along with illustrations of how to estimate multilevel models to synthesize single-case data with a user-friendly app (Chapter 7 if there are no trends, or Chapter 8 if there are trends). Finally, those interested in synthesizing single-case design studies where the outcome measures vary across cases, and especially if they are interested in examining how the size of the effect varies from case to case, should consider the case-specific effect size approach. They can turn to Chapter 9, which introduces this approach and its assumptions, and Chapter 10, which provides step-by-step instructions along with illustration of how to estimate case-specific effect sizes with a user-friendly app. Datasets Acknowledgements We are grateful for the guidance from Katherine Taylor, who served as our project officer at the Institute of Education Sciences.
