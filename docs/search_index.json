Effect Size Estimation and Synthesis of Single-Case Designs: A Methods Guide. Institute of Education Sciences. U.S. Department of Education. Washington, DC. Retrieved from https://jepusto.github.io/SCD-Methods-Guide/ Preface We developed the Methods Guide to support educational researchers interested in estimating effect size measures and synthesizing findings from single-case design studies. To do so, we aim to do two things: (a) provide guidance and decision rules to simplify the process of selecting effect size estimation and synthesis methods and (b) illustrate the step-by-step application of appropriate methods using readily available tools. The guide is not meant to cover all effect size methods that have been proposed for single-case design studies, nor is it meant to summarize all of the research on effect size estimation and synthesis of single-case research. Rather, it is meant to provide easy-to-follow decision rules, along with step-by-step instructions and illustrations of user-friendly tools, so that researchers aiming to conduct a synthesis involving single-case studies are more readily able to do so. The guide is organized so that researchers can go immediately to the sections and chapters that are relevant to their immediate task, rather than having to read the guide sequentially from start to finish. The first chapter provides background and a flow chart (also shown below) to help researchers select among three broad approaches to synthesizing results from single-case research. Figure 0.1: Approaches to synthesizing findings from single-case research Those interested in synthesizing both single-case and group design studies should consider the design-comparable effect size approach and start by reading Chapter 2, which introduces this approach and its assumptions. They can then turn to one of the more detailed chapters providing step-by-step illustrations of how to estimate design comparable effect sizes with a user-friendly app (Chapter 3 if there are no trends, Chapter 4 if there are trends only in the treatment phases, or Chapter 5 if there are trends in both the baseline and treatment phases). Those interested in synthesizing single-case design studies that share a common outcome, and particularly if they are interested in examining changes in the effect over time, should consider the multilevel modeling approach and read Chapter 6, which introduces this approach and its assumptions. They can then turn to one of the more detailed chapters providing step-by-step instructions along with illustrations of how to estimate multilevel models to synthesize single-case data with a user-friendly app (Chapter 7 if there are no trends, or Chapter 8 if there are trends). Finally, those interested in synthesizing single-case design studies where the outcome measures vary across cases, and especially if they are interested in examining how the size of the effect varies from case to case, should consider the case-specific effect size approach. They can turn to Chapter 9, which introduces this approach and its assumptions, and Chapter 10, which provides step-by-step instructions along with illustration of how to estimate case-specific effect sizes with a user-friendly app. Datasets Acknowledgements We are grateful for the guidance from Katherine Taylor, who served as our project officer at the Institute of Education Sciences.

We provide an overview of the three major approaches for effect size estimation and synthesis of single-case studies: (a) design-comparable effect sizes, (b) multilevel modeling of raw individual participant interrupted time-series data, and (c) case-specific effect sizes. We describe the general motivation and rationale for each approach and provide a series of decision rules to guide researchers in their selection. Subsequent chapters in this guide provide more detailed illustrations of the three major approaches. 1.1 Background Educational decisions made at the state, district, school, and student levels are expected to be informed by empirical evidence (Cook et al., 2014; What Works Clearinghouse, 2020b). These expectations create a compelling need for synthesis, or the integration of research findings from multiple, existing sources of evidence—including findings from single-case designs (SCDs). The need for methods to synthesis findings from SCDs is all the greater because some educational disciplines have historically relied upon this methodology to collect evidence about interventions, such that the bulk of available evidence about some interventions comes from SCDs. This methods guide responds to three key developments in educational research related to the documentation of evidence-based practices. The first is the expanded use of SCD research methods across disciplines over the last 50 years in both general and special education contexts (L. Kratochwill Thomas R. &amp; Swoboda, 2014). Although the history of SCD methodology is outside our present scope, SCD design innovations have allowed researchers to advance its use beyond quasi-experimental and behavior analysis origins (see L. Kratochwill Thomas R. &amp; Swoboda, 2014 for more detailed information on the history of SCD). Over the past 20 years, researchers’ commitment to using rigorous procedures to identify evidence-based educational practices affirms not only the importance of randomized control trials (RCTs), but also the utility and efficiency of SCDs. The second key development in education research is the emergence of effect size measures and synthesis methods for use with SCD and other interrupted time-series data (Shadish et al., 2015; Swaminathan et al., 2014). Interest in the synthesis of SCDs is long-standing (e.g., Center et al., 1985; Gingerich, 1984; White, 1987), with methods arising concurrently with the meta-analyses of group design research becoming more statistically rigorous and sophisticated (Hedges &amp; Olkin, 1985; Shadish &amp; Lecy, 2015). The interest and intensity of methodological research focused on SCDs has increased over time, resulting in a substantial expansion in the diversity, flexibility, and accessibility of available analytic methods. The current state of SCD effect size estimation methods can be categorized into three strands: (a) approaches that summarize the effect for each case and then synthesize these case-specific effect sizes (e.g., Pustejovsky, 2018), (b) methods that use multi-level models to analyze the raw or standardized data from one or multiple SCD studies (Van den Noortgate &amp; Onghena, 2008), and (c) techniques that use design-comparable effect size metrics (Hedges et al., 2012, 2013; Pustejovsky et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2014; Swaminathan et al., 2014). We organize the present methods guide around these three broad methodological strands. The third development in education research is the increased use of systematic review and meta-analysis procedures to identify and affirm evidence-based practices in education (Beretvas &amp; Chung, 2008; Shadish &amp; Rindskopf, 2007). In examining the production of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of SCDs from 1985 to 2009, Maggin et al. (2011) found a marked increase in such products between 2000 and 2009. Similarly, Jamshidi et al. (2018) found increasing production through 2015, as well as improvements in the quality of published reviews. However, even contemporary reviews frequently fail to use appropriate methods for combining findings across studies (Jamshidi et al., 2018). Thus, there remains a need for guidance about how to select and apply methods for synthesizing SCD research results. Effect size measures are a valuable complement to visual analysis for the interpretation of single-case research results and are a key input in two of the available approaches for meta-analytic synthesis of SCDs: case-specific and design-comparable effect size estimation methods. Researchers have a variety of technically sound effect size metrics to select from when interpreting SCD findings, but relatively few published meta-analyses use design-comparable effect sizes, multilevel modeling, or more advanced case-specific effect sizes (cf. Barton et al., 2017; Jamshidi et al., 2018; Maggin et al., 2017). One reason for their lack of widespread use by researchers may be the conceptual and procedural complexity associated with advances in effect size measures and meta-analysis techniques. The complexity of data extraction and calculation of effect sizes for SCDs may also hinder a more rapid uptake of effect size estimation methods. In addition, researchers may lack software tools for effect size estimation for single-case studies when using some common statistical packages such as SPSS and SAS (Odom et al., 2018; Shadish et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2015). 1.2 Purpose of the Methods Guide The purpose of this methods guide is to improve educational researchers’ practice of estimating effect size measures and synthesizing findings from SCDs. We recognize that no single method is ideal for all research goals. Furthermore, methods that have the most to offer can be complex and may appear difficult to carry out. Through the use of this methods guide, we aim to (a) provide guidance and decision rules to simplify the process of selecting effect size estimation and synthesis methods, and (b) illustrate the step-by-step application of appropriate methods using readily available tools, such as web-based software to calculate case-specific effect sizes or design-comparable effect sizes for SCD studies. 1.3 Study Quality Conducting a research synthesis—composed of group design studies, SCDs, or both—involves several stages: formulating the research aims, specifying inclusion criteria, conducting a systematic search, and screening for eligible studies (H. M. Cooper, 2010; Pustejovsky &amp; Ferron, 2017). Additionally, before carrying out effect size calculations or meta-analysis, it is critical to consider the methodological quality and potential biases of studies one includes in the synthesis. Several distinct sets of standards are available for SCD studies to assist researchers with assessing methodological quality (e.g., T. R. Kratochwill et al., 2013, 2021; Reichow et al., 2018; Tate et al., 2016; Zimmerman et al., 2018). After examining the methodological quality of studies eligible for inclusion in a review, researchers can use one of two strategies to guide their estimation and synthesis of effect sizes. One strategy incorporates consideration of study quality as an inclusion criterion. Researchers can screen studies and exclude low-quality studies so that the synthesis is based on a subset of studies with quality deemed adequate or high enough that outcome(s) can be attributed to the intervention. For example, the What Works Clearinghouse (2020a) indicates that for researchers to include an SCD study in a meta-analysis, the study must meet minimum design criteria (e.g., a multiple baseline study has at least three temporally spaced opportunities for the effect to be demonstrated, along with phases of at least three observations) and must provide minimum evidence of experimental control over extraneous factors (e.g., baselines do not document a therapeutic trend). Other screening approaches that rely on visual analysis have also been suggested (T. R. Kratochwill et al., 2021; Maggin et al., 2021). Alternatively, researchers can use broader inclusion criteria, but then carefully code for aspects of study quality, so that they can examine study quality codes as potential moderators in a meta-analysis. With this approach, researchers can estimate effect sizes for studies of varying degrees of quality and empirically explore whether the variation in effect size across studies is dependent on aspects of study quality. We assume that researchers who use this methods guide will have already selected a method to assess study quality and an approach for incorporating those assessments into their synthesis. Thus, we do not focus on SCD study quality assessment methods, but rather provide guidelines that researchers can apply to a collection of studies meeting their inclusion criteria, which potentially include study quality. In this guide we focus on the final stages of a research synthesis—those involving questions of how to select a method for estimating effects, how to compute effect size estimates (or otherwise prepare data for synthesis), and how to synthesize findings in the form of effect size estimates or individual-level data. 1.4 Selecting an Approach for Effect Estimation and Synthesis To select an approach for estimating and synthesizing effects from SCDs, researchers should first reflect on the research aims that motivate their synthesis. In some contexts, researchers’ primary aims may be summarizing evidence to arrive at statements about the average efficacy of a class of interventions. In other circumstances, researchers might be interested in understanding variation in effects and the extent to which such variation is associated with participants’ characteristics, specific intervention features, or other contextual factors. When summarization is a priority, researchers may find it more useful to use design-comparable effect sizes that describe average effects. If individual-level variation is the focus, then approaches using case-specific effect sizes or multilevel modeling may be more advantageous. Another overarching consideration for selecting a synthesis approach pertains to the features of the included studies. Quantitative synthesis requires choosing an effect size metric that permits comparisons of the magnitude of effects across individual participants and studies. Consequently, the extent to which eligible studies use different types of designs or different outcome measures constrains how effects from those studies can be described or compared. For instance, if all eligible studies in the review used multiple baseline designs across participants (or another common type of SCD), then several different synthesis approaches are feasible. In contrast, if eligible studies include both single-case and group design studies (e.g., small randomized experiments, each with a single pre-test and a single post-test), researchers may seek a synthesis approach that permits comparisons across both design types. If all eligible studies used SCDs with very similar methods for assessing the dependent variable, then synthesis based on multilevel modeling of raw data is possible. In contrast, if eligible studies used non-equivalent assessments, then researchers may need to use a synthesis approach based on case-specific effect sizes that are suitable for comparison across studies involving different assessments. These two broad considerations—the aims of the synthesis and the features of eligible studies—should guide the selection of an approach for synthesis of SCDs. We now detail how the three broad synthesis approaches fit within these considerations. 1.5 Design-Comparable Effect Sizes In some situations, researchers aim to synthesize the evidence for intervention effectiveness using both single-case and group design studies. For example, a meta-analysis by Wood et al. (2018) analyzed 22 single-case and between-group studies to examine the effects of text-to-speech and other read-aloud tools on reading comprehension outcomes for students with reading disabilities. The authors used the standardized mean difference to estimate read-aloud intervention effects in the group design studies and a comparable standardized mean difference to estimate effects from the included SCD research, resulting in an overall average weighted effect size of d= 0.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.14, 0.56]. Because the purpose of the study involved the comparison and averaging of effects across single-case and group designs, it was critical that Wood et al. (2018) used an effect size metric that is theoretically comparable across the designs. Researchers should select from the design-comparable effect size options (e.g., accounting for the absence or presence of baseline trends) when the aim is to compare and synthesize effects across eligible SCD and group design studies (Hedges et al., 2012, 2013; Pustejovsky et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2014; Swaminathan et al., 2014; Van den Noortgate &amp; Onghena, 2008). However, if researchers aim to synthesize findings from only SCD studies (i.e., not to integrate findings across single-case and group design studies), it may be feasible and preferable to use other options, such as synthesizing effects using case-specific effect sizes or multilevel modeling. 1.6 Case-Specific Effect Sizes In addition to averaging effects across studies, researchers may also be interested in exploring variation in treatment effects by categorical differences or individual participant characteristics (e.g., Do effects vary across settings? Are effects consistent across ethnic and racial groups?). When included studies use different outcome measures (e.g., included studies report outcomes measured on different scales such as a rate per session, occurrence/count, or ratio), it is important for researchers to use an effect size metric and synthesis approach that accounts for such. For example, Bowman-Perrott et al. (2016) examined five potential moderators (emotional and behavioral disorder risk status, reinforcement frequency, target behaviors, intervention format, and grade level) in their synthesis of 21 SCDs to obtain an overall effect of the Good Behavior Game in promoting positive behavior in the classroom. Results of their meta-analysis suggested that the intervention was more effective in reducing problem behaviors among students with or at risk for emotional and behavioral disorders. Another meta-analysis by Mason et al. (2016) first calculated and aggregated the effect sizes across all included studies, and then investigated the moderating effects of participant characteristics, targeted outcomes, and implementation components on the efficacy of video self-modeling, in which a learner with disabilities watches a video of a model engaged in targeted skills or tasks. They found that intervention effects were stronger for younger participants with autism spectrum disorders compared to those not identified as autistic or having an autism spectrum disorder. Because these syntheses focused on investigating variation across individuals in the effect of treatment, it was important that the effect size estimation and synthesis approach produced effect estimates for each individual participant (rather than a study-level summary effect estimate). Design-comparable effect size options are not viable for studying within-participant effects or variation in effects between individuals within the study because these effect sizes produce estimates at the study level (i.e., the effect averaged across the cases), not the individual level. Furthermore, outcome measures differed widely among studies included in the aforementioned reviews, so the researchers needed an individual-level effect size metric that was not scale-dependent (e.g., not based on simple raw score mean differences). When included studies use outcome measurements that cannot simply be re-scaled to be equivalent, case-specific effect size estimation and synthesis options may be best suited. However, the case-specific effect size options are not viable for meta-analysts wanting a single overall effect size after synthesizing both single-case design and group design studies because case-specific effects are not comparable to group design effects. 1.7 Multilevel Modeling of Individual Participant Interrupted Time-Series Data When a set of SCDs use the same or very similar outcome measures with the aim of studying the variation in effects over time within and between individuals, the multilevel modeling approach should be considered. For example, Datchuk et al. (2020) meta-analyzed 15 single-case studies totaling 79 students to examine the effects of an intervention on the level and trend in correct writing sequences per minute for students with disabilities. The researchers found that effect sizes were greater when students received intervention for longer durations (i.e., there was a positive effect on the trend) and that this temporal change in effect was more pronounced with younger students. In contexts like this, we suggest researchers avoid a meta-analytic approach that relies on a single effect size estimate for a study (e.g., design-comparable effect sizes) or even a single effect estimate for a case (e.g., case-specific effect sizes) and consider options for multilevel modeling of individual participant data series instead. 1.8 Summary of Options for Effect Estimation and Synthesis The flow chart in Figure 1.1 illustrates a set of heuristic decision rules for selecting among the three general approaches to synthesizing results from single-case research. If the primary purpose of one’s research is to integrate findings from both single-case and group-design studies, researchers should consider design-comparable effect sizes, contextually noting that effects are likely to be different for group design studies than from SCD studies M. Chen &amp; Pustejovsky (2022). Alternately, if the researchers plan to only include SCD studies, then they can use two other approaches (i.e., multilevel modeling and case-specific effect sizes). The choice between the latter two is related to the measurement of the dependent variable. Where there is interest in variability in effects across cases and over time, researchers should consider multilevel modeling of the raw data series, so long as the outcome is measured consistently across cases. However, if the aim is to examine how effects vary across the cases but the outcome measurements are non-equivalent and cannot be easily equated, then researchers should consider the options for estimating and synthesizing case-specific effect sizes. Figure 1.1: Approaches to Synthesizing Results from Single-Case Research 1.9 Limitations in Selecting an Approach for Effect Estimation and Synthesis We emphasize that Figure 1.1 presents a heuristic, simplified procedure for selecting among the three general approaches to effect size estimation and synthesis, which cannot and does not cover every possible research context. We anticipate and acknowledge that there will be situations where researchers’ aims and contexts differ from those we have described and thus do not align perfectly with one of our primary approaches to estimating and synthesizing single-case effect sizes. For example, researchers who are synthesizing findings from a set of SCDs may wish to compare their results to a previously published meta-analysis of group design studies, but not to investigate individual-level variation in treatment effects. They might therefore elect to use design-comparable effect sizes even though they are not formally integrating results from group design studies within their review. A further possibility is that researchers might elect to use multiple approaches to synthesis to address different aims or research questions. For example, consider a project in which researchers have identified both single-case and group design studies. They might want to integrate findings across design types while also exploring the variation in effects among individuals. In this scenario, researchers could estimate design-comparable effect sizes for their first aim and case-specific effect sizes from the subset of SCDs for their second aim. We also acknowledge that situations may arise that fall between those we described for case-specific effect sizes and those for multilevel modeling of the raw data series. For example, researchers may want to examine how effects vary over time and across cases, using studies with different outcomes. For this purpose, the researchers will need to identify and apply extensions of the primary approaches we present in this guide. For example, the researchers could either standardize the raw data before estimating a multilevel model, or they could synthesize case-specific effect sizes using multiple standardized effects for each case (e.g., an effect that indexes the immediate shift in level, and another effect that indexes a change in slope). In this guide, we aim to address what we perceive to be the most common scenarios, rather than conduct an exhaustive review of all possibilities. Finally, we anticipate that the heuristic guidance we provide here will need to be refined over time as further methodological innovations become available. We anticipate that research presently underway will provide even more meta-analytic options, with implications for how to select an approach for synthesis. At some point it may be possible to compute case-specific effect sizes that are also design-comparable, or it may be possible to standardize the data for multilevel models in a way that leads to parameter estimates from the model that correspond to design-comparable effect estimates. When such methods become available, some distinctions made here will become artificial. However, even as methodology continues to advance, researchers need guidance that acknowledges the complexity of research purposes and contexts and is dynamic in its accommodation of such variation, while also being concrete and straightforward enough for widespread implementation. To support the uptake of advanced methods for meta-analytic synthesis by educational researchers, the remainder of this guide follows the proposed heuristics for selecting among the three major approaches to effect size estimation and synthesis. 1.10 Structure of the Methods Guide We divide this guide into three major sections: (a) design-comparable effect size estimation and synthesis, (b) multilevel modeling, and (c) case-specific effect size estimation and synthesis to estimate and synthesize effects. Each section is independent; they are not in a particular chronological order, nor do they build upon each other. Rather, we expect those using this guide to follow the decision rules in Figure 1.1 to determine which approach is most appropriate for them, and then reference the corresponding relevant section. We divide each section into chapters. Each initial chapter introduces the specific approach to synthesizing results from SCD research, its assumptions, and determination for use. We then provide additional decision rules for selecting among the specific techniques and options available within a given broad approach. This is followed by an illustration where we: Describe the purposes for estimating and synthesizing effects, and the available data. Demonstrate how to use the decision rules in Figure 1.1, along with the additional decision rules specific to the initial section chapter, to arrive at the option being illustrated. Present the illustrated data to show how it needs to be structured for the analysis. Provide a step-by-step illustration of how to estimate and synthesize effects using readily available analysis tools. References Barton, E. E., Pustejovsky, J. E., Maggin, D. M., &amp; Reichow, B.

We highlight both the assumptions for using design-comparable effect sizes in meta-analytic synthesis and the assumptions for estimation of these effect sizes from primary study data. We then describe available options for estimating design-comparable effect sizes. These options allow for different assumptions regarding trends in baseline or treatment phases and different assumptions about the variation in the treatment effect across cases. This chapter concludes with a set of decision rules for selecting among the options for design-comparable effect sizes. 2.1 Background Design-comparable effect sizes are effect size indices for single case studies that are on the same metric as effect size indices used in group comparison studies (Hedges et al., 2012, 2013; Pustejovsky et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2014; Swaminathan et al., 2014; Van den Noortgate &amp; Onghena, 2008). These design-comparable effect sizes are valuable in a variety of synthesis contexts, particularly those that involve both single-case design (SCD) and group comparison studies. However, these methods also have several limitations. First, design-comparable effect sizes rely on an estimate of the variance between participants, requiring at least three distinct participants for estimation. This constrains their use to SCDs involving multiple participants (e.g., multiple baseline design across participants) or close replications of SCDs, each of which has a single participant (e.g., ABAB design replicated across several students). Further, existing research on design-comparable effect size methods is only available for multiple baseline, multiple probe, or replicated treatment reversal designs. Researchers have yet to develop extensions for alternating treatment designs and other types of SCDs. However, ongoing research is likely to increase the designs for which design-comparable effect sizes can be estimated. A second conceptual limitation is that design-comparable effect sizes produce a single summary effect size per outcome—which represents an average effect across participants—just as between-group design study effect sizes are summaries of average effects across participants. As a result, the design-comparable effect size might conceal heterogeneity of effects across participants in an SCD. Meta-analytic researchers are then limited to moderator analyses focused on study-level characteristics; it is not feasible to examine potential moderators that vary across cases in a study or across time points within a case. A third limitation is that design-comparable effect sizes are based on a hierarchical model that involves specific assumptions about the distribution of outcomes measured in the study. Developing a reasonable model requires care and attention to the plausibility of its assumptions. It is not a trivial or automatic process (as effect size calculations for between-group experimental designs are sometimes treated). Moreover, for some types of outcomes, the distributional assumptions of the model may be inappropriate, which further limits the applicability of the design-comparable effect size. To address these methodological limitations, we use this chapter to provide researchers with guidance on the selection and use of design-comparable effect size estimates. We describe six of the most common modeling options and provide guidance on how to select among these options when calculating design-comparable effect size for use in a research synthesis. 2.2 When to Use Design-Comparable Effect Sizes When choosing an effect size for single-case design data, researchers should begin by considering the broader purpose for computing effect sizes. In some cases, researchers may want to synthesize results across different types of studies, as in a comprehensive synthesis of all studies conducted on a topic. For example, researchers conducting a meta-analysis might include all studies examining the effects of social skills interventions on the social and academic outcomes of elementary-aged students with disabilities. In some areas of education research, it is likely that the literature identified for synthesis includes both group and single-case experimental studies. To average the effect across studies with different designs, researchers must pick an effect size index that has a comparable interpretation for each of the included designs (Hedges et al., 2012, 2013; Pustejovsky et al., 2014; Shadish et al., 2015). For exactly this purpose, methodologists developed the design-comparable effect size for SCDs, providing an effect size on a common metric by answering the question, “What would the standardized mean difference effect size be if one could somehow perform a between-group randomized experiment based on the same population of participants, intervention protocol, and outcome measures?” 2.3 General Definition of Design-Comparable Effect Sizes To understand the logic of the design-comparable effect size, it is helpful to consider how effect sizes are defined in group design studies. In a between-groups randomized experiment comparing a treatment condition (Tx) to a control condition (C) for a specified population, researchers commonly summarize results using the standardized mean difference effect size index. In Equation (2.1), we define this effect size parameter as \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.1} \\delta = \\frac{\\mu_{Tx} - \\mu_C}{\\sigma_C}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mu_{Tx}\\) is the average outcome if the entire population received the treatment condition, \\(\\mu_C\\) is the average outcome if the entire population received the control condition, and \\(\\sigma_C\\) is the standard deviation of the outcome if the entire population received the control condition. The effect size may be estimated by substituting sample means and sample standard deviations in place of the corresponding population quantities (Borenstein, 2009), or by pooling sample standard deviations across the intervention and control conditions under the assumption that the population variance is equal. Alternately, the mean difference in the numerator of the effect size can be estimated based on a statistical model, such as an analysis of covariance that adjusts for between-group differences in baseline characteristics (Taylor et al., 2022). Researchers often apply the Hedges \\(g\\) small-sample correction, which reduces the bias of the effect size estimator that arises from estimating \\(\\sigma_C\\) based on a limited number of observations (Hedges, 1981). Using data from a multiple baseline, multiple probe, or replicated treatment reversal design, the design-comparable effect size for SCDs aims to estimate the same quantity as the standardized mean difference from a between-groups experiment. This task poses challenges because the data from such SCDs involve repeated measurements taken over time. To precisely define the design-comparable effect size, researchers must therefore be specific about the timing of both intervention implementation and outcome assessment. Hypothetically, if a between-groups experiment uses the same study procedures as the SCD, researchers would still need to determine and specify when to begin intervention and when to collect outcome data. Furthering this example, suppose that the SCD takes place over times \\(t=1,...,T\\). In our hypothetical between-groups experiment, intervention starts at time \\(A\\) for \\(1 \\leq A &lt; T\\) and collection of outcome data for all participants occurs at time \\(B\\) for \\(A &lt; B\\). The standardized mean difference from such an experiment would contrast the average outcome at time \\(B\\) if the entire population had started intervention at time \\(A\\) [i.e., \\(\\mu_B(A)\\)] to the average outcome at time \\(B\\) if the entire population had remained in baseline through time \\(B\\) and then started intervention later at time \\(T\\) [i.e., \\(\\mu_B(T)\\)]. The standardized mean difference would then correspond to \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{2.2} \\delta_{AB} = \\frac{\\mu_B(A) - \\mu_B(T)}{\\sigma_B(T)}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\mu_B(A)\\) is the average outcome at follow-up time \\(B\\) if the entire population were to receive the intervention at time \\(A\\). Then, \\(\\mu_B(T)\\) is the average outcome at follow-up time \\(B\\) if the entire population were to receive the intervention at time \\(T\\). Finally, \\(\\sigma_B(T)\\) is the standard deviation of the outcome at follow-up time \\(B\\) if the entire population were to receive the intervention at time \\(T\\). Note that \\(\\mu_B(T)\\) corresponds to the average outcome under the control condition (\\(\\mu_C\\), above), because participants would not yet have received intervention as of time \\(B\\). Similarly \\(\\sigma_B(T)\\) is the analogue of \\(\\sigma_C\\), the standard deviation of the outcome under the control condition because participants would not yet have received the intervention as of time \\(B\\). Pustejovsky et al. (2014) described a strategy for estimating \\(\\delta_{AB}\\) using data from an SCD study. Broadly, the strategy involves specifying a multilevel model for the data, estimating the component quantities \\(\\mu_B(A)\\), \\(\\mu_B(T)\\), and \\(\\sigma_B(T)\\) based on the specified model, and applying a small-sample correction analogous to Hedges \\(g\\). However, because of the need to estimate the standard deviation of the outcome across the participant population [\\(\\sigma_B(T)\\)], this strategy only works if the SCD study includes data from multiple participants. The approach involves a multilevel model for the data because SCDs involve repeated measurements collected for each of several participants. The first level of the model describes the pattern of repeated measurements over time nested within a given participant and the second level of the model describes how the first-level parameters vary across participants. As a result, the model involves deconstructing \\(\\sigma_B(T)\\) into two components: within-participant variation and between-participant variation. This process is not typically possible in a between-groups randomized experiment unless researchers collect repeated outcome measures for each participant. 2.4 What We Assume When We Synthesize Design-Comparable Effect Sizes The motivation for using the design-comparable effect size δ from SCD studies is strongest when researchers intend to synthesize SCD and group design studies in the same meta-analysis. If assumptions needed for synthesis are not reasonably met, it may be more appropriate to analyze the SCD and group design studies separately. Then, researchers may want to consider alternative effect size metrics for the SCD studies. For this reason, this chapter presents the broader synthesis assumptions prior to the specific assumptions needed for estimating design-comparable effect sizes. The random effects model is the predominant statistical model for synthesizing effect sizes across studies. With this statistical model, we do not assume that the population effect size estimated in one study is identical to the population effect size estimated from another study. Rather, we assume that the effect size estimated for Study \\(j\\) may differ from the effect size estimated for Study \\(k\\) (e.g., \\(\\sigma_j \\ne \\sigma_k\\)). There are several general frameworks for explaining why the effect size may vary from one study to the next. One such framework posits that differences can arise from variation across studies in the units, treatments, observing operations, and settings [UTOS; Becker (1996)]. The inclusion and exclusion criteria for the meta-analysis can be set up to constrain (but not completely eliminate) the variation from study to study on these dimensions. Use of a random effects model for the summary meta-analysis and the exploration of moderators of the treatment effects is warranted because some degree of variation in effects is anticipated. There are several different ways to understand the assumptions underlying the random effects model. One way is to imagine that the included studies in a synthesis represent a random sample from a super-population of possible studies on the topic of interest. In a Bayesian framework, the model can also be motivated by the assumption of exchangeability, meaning that the effect size of studies included in a synthesis are on a common metric that permits judgements of similarity and that their relative magnitude cannot be systematically predicted a priori (Higgins et al., 2009). For brevity, we refer to both suppositions (i.e., the super-population and Bayesian motivations) as the exchangeability assumption. Crucially, the exchangeability assumption depends on the effect size metric used for synthesis; for a given set of studies, the assumption may be reasonable for one effect size metric but unreasonable for another. Thus far, we have defined the standardized mean difference metric (\\(\\delta\\)) for design-comparable effect sizes for SCDs. Therefore, we now consider the exchangeability of \\(\\delta s\\). When intending to synthesize a set of studies where there is considerable variation among the study outcomes, sampled units, or treatments (i.e., they differ greatly from one another on one or more of these UTOS characteristics), then the \\(\\delta s\\) from these studies are likely not exchangeable. In contrast, when there is similarity in the UTOS, exchangeability is more reasonable. As an example, for the standardized mean difference metric, exchangeability is more plausible when one study’s population of participants closely mirrors the participant population characteristics from another study (i.e., similar, if not same, inclusion criteria). Further, when the populations are similar and studies use the exact same operational measure of the dependent variable, we can assume that the distribution of outcomes in the control condition has similar variance. Alternatively, if the two studies drew from populations with very different characteristics so that the disbursement of the study results (distribution of the dependent variable) varied widely, an intervention that produces identical effects on the scale of the dependent variable would have quite different effect sizes on the scale of the standardized mean difference. When populations are distinctly different, the exchangeability assumption is less tenable. Thus, we encourage researchers to examine the studies they plan to include in their synthesis for the potential lack of exchangeability. Researchers can explore this aspect of the exchangeability assumption by examining the sampling methods and measurement procedures of the included studies. When subsets of studies use the same operational measure of the dependent variable, the between-participant (case) variance in those studies can be compared. To illustrate the exploration of between-case variability, consider the sampling procedures used in the following two studies extracted from Datchuk et al. (2020) that examined the effect of interventions on writing performance as measured by correct word sequences (CWS). In one study, the sample consisted of three 7-year-old White males identified by their teachers as struggling with writing (Parker et al., 2012). In the other study (Stotz et al., 2008), the sample comprised three 10-year-old students who exhibited poor writing skills. The first student was a Black male identified with an emotional disturbance, the second student was a White male identified with a specific learning disability, and the third student was a White female identified with a specific learning disability. Presented with this information, we then seek to answer the following questions: (a) Are these samples similar enough to satisfy the exchangeability assumption with the standardized mean difference metric? (b) Might the second sample with variation in differences in participant characteristics (age, race, gender, and educational disability category), be so much more variable in writing performance that it is not reasonable to use the standardized mean difference metric to judge similarity of effects across both studies? In the first study (Parker et al., 2012), the mean number of CWS during baseline for the three participants were 8.29, 15.0, and 10.8. In the second study (Stotz et al., 2008), participants’ mean CWS baseline levels were 14.6, 29.1, and 22.1. In Study 1, the between-case variation, as indexed by the standard deviation (SD) of the three baseline means, is 3.4, whereas the between-case SD is 7.3 in Study 2. Now we must consider whether this difference is large enough to distort the design-comparable effect size. To address our questions, we first consider the raw score effect size for each study by specifying a multilevel model that assumes no trends in baseline or treatment phases, and variation in the effect across cases. In Study 1, the shift in the expected number of CWS when moving from baseline to intervention, or raw score effect size, is 10.7. In Study 2, the CWS raw score effect size is 9.6, about 1.1 times smaller than the raw score effect size for Study 1. Next, we consider the design-comparable effect size computed using the same model used for the raw score effect size. The design-comparable effect size is 0.962 for Study 1 and 0.827 for Study 2; the effect size for Study 1 is approximately 1.2 times greater than Study 2, like the ratio of the observed raw score effect sizes. We anticipate that future research will provide guidance regarding how much difference in sampling (and resulting between-case variability) researchers can accommodate without creating notable problems for the synthesis of design-comparable effect sizes. Similarly, researchers will continue to investigate, and hopefully establish consensus about, the degree to which differences among outcomes and treatments between studies are tolerable to have confidence in their effect size results. Until then, we suggest that meta-analysts be aware of the underlying exchangeability assumption (that the effect sizes expressed on a given metric are exchangeable across studies) and be forthright and transparent about their findings when reporting results of their synthesis. If the differences in the units, treatments, observing operations, and settings between the SCD studies and the group studies are much larger than the differences among either the SCD or group studies, it may be preferable to meta-analyze the SCD and group studies separately. Conversely, if the differences are negligible from one set of studies to the next, the exchangeability assumption is more tenable, and attention can be turned to the assumptions necessary to estimate the design-comparable effect size. 2.4.1 What We Assume When We Estimate Design-Comparable Effect Size Design-comparable effect sizes for SCD studies rely on multilevel models. Estimation is based on several key assumptions, including distributional assumptions about the errors. The models assume that observations for each case are normally distributed around the case-specific trend line, and the variation of observations around the trend line is homogeneous from one phase to the next and from one case to the next. In addition, there are assumptions about the underlying structural model, including whether there are trends in phases. Below, we explain these assumptions in greater detail and provide exemplars of each. 2.4.2 Normality Use of design-comparable effect sizes assumes that the experimental observations are normally distributed around the case-specific trend lines. The data may be consistent with this assumption of normality, but not always. For example, Ota &amp; DuPaul (2002) utilized a multiple baseline design across three participants to examine the effects of a math software intervention with a game component on the off-task behaviors of students with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). To examine the normality assumption, we extracted the study data using Webplot Digitizer (Rohatgi, 2015) and present it in Figure 2.1. When examining the baseline phases, observations appear to be distributed somewhat normally around the baseline means, with a pooled skewness value near zero (\\(sk = 0.15\\)) and a pooled kurtosis value near zero (\\(ku = -0.77\\)). However, we observe non-normality in the treatment phases because the outcome is a percentage that has remained near the floor of 0% for much of the treatment phase (\\(sk = 1.86\\); \\(ku = 4.99\\)). Figure 2.1: Multiple Baseline Design Across Three Participants (Ota &amp; DuPaul, 2002) With count-based variables, we often anticipate some departures from the traditional normality assumption. These departures tend to be more pronounced when a count variable has a phase mean close to zero. Departures from the traditional normality assumption are more pronounced when a percentage variable has a phase mean close to either end of the \\(0\\%-100\\%\\) range. These situations are common in published SCDs because the quality of an SCD study is often judged on the stability and level of observations in baseline and treatment phases. For example, if researchers design an intervention to increase a non-reversible behavior (e.g., academic skill), it would be ideal to only recruit participants without the target skill in their repertoire so that observations in the baseline phase reflect such-they would have baseline observations at or near 0. Conversely, an SCD recommendation for behavior-reduction interventions is to seek low rates or non-occurrence of the target behavior in the treatment phase, communicating that the intervention effectively led to the amelioration or extinction of a problem behavior. However, distributions may more closely align with the normality assumption when treatment phase counts are higher than 0, or the percentage variable has a mean closer to \\(50\\%\\). Available evidence indicates that design-comparable effect sizes can tolerate a moderate degree of non-normality for relatively simple model specifications (L.-T. Chen et al., 2023). However, additional research is needed to determine how much non-normality can be present before there are substantial consequences for the design-comparable effect size. 2.4.3 Homogeneity of Variance In addition to assuming normality, the illustrations of design-comparable effect size estimation provided in this guide all assume that the within-case variation is homogeneous across phases and cases within a study. Although assumptions of homogeneity across cases and phases may be reasonable, there are situations when researchers should not assume homogeneity of variance. Consider again the Ota &amp; DuPaul (2002) study, with the multiple baseline design graphs in Figure 2.1. Results of our visual analysis suggest that the variance differs between the baseline and treatment phases, with less variation in the treatment phase as the percentage of off-task behaviors decreased and approached 0 (i.e., extinction). With count-based variables (e.g., raw counts or counts converted to percentages), variability often depends on the variable mean. Thus, treatments that shift the mean tend to change the variance. If studies have unstructured baselines, substantial variability is common. If there is tight experimental control in the intervention phase (e.g., researchers predict and control for interventionist/peer attention, strong treatment fidelity), we might expect some reduction in variance. With studies like these, where the variance differs between the baseline and treatment phases, we recommend estimating a more complex multilevel model that yields separate variance estimates for the two phases rather than assuming homogeneity across phases. Such models are feasible to estimate using the tools presented in subsequent chapters, but are beyond the scope of the guide. Until future research provides more concrete guidance about the best ways to proceed when encountering between-case heterogeneity, meta-analysts must remain aware of their assumptions and transparent about analytic decisions when reporting methods and results. Upon discovering substantial violations to the normality or homogeneity assumptions, we encourage researchers to consider whether violations to the exchangeability assumption needed for synthesis are also present. For example, imagine that meta-analysts interested in synthesizing the effects of oral narrative interventions select a multiple baseline design study that has all cases reporting baseline observations consistently at or near 0. It is likely that both the normality and homogeneity assumptions are violated for this study. It is also likely that the outcome used in the hypothetical study differs greatly from the outcomes used in the included group design studies. This leads to questions about the exchangeability of the effect sizes. In such circumstances, we advise against trying to force the computation of a design-comparable effect size and the synthesis of SCD and group design studies together. A more appropriate synthesis option may be to meta-analyze the SCD and group design studies separately, allowing for the use of a more appropriate effect size metric for the SCD studies separate from that used for the group design studies. However, we expect that normality and homogeneity of variance assumption violations will often be more modest (or non-existent) than in the above example, so that researchers can continue to entertain the use of the design-comparable effect size. 2.4.4 Appropriate Structural Model The estimation of design-comparable effect sizes requires assumptions about the structural model for the data series collected in the SCD. Ideally, these assumptions are based on content expertise, knowledge of the intervention domain, and understanding of the dependent variable(s) under review. The assumptions also rely on visual analysis and calculation of descriptive statistics from the studies. Regarding baseline trend, given our knowledge and understanding of the behavior(s), context(s), and participants included in the studies, we can assume one of three things: no trend in baseline, a linear trend in baseline, or some form of nonlinear trend. Similarly, we can use the same knowledge to make assumptions about data trends in the treatment phase: no trend, linear trend, or nonlinear trend. Furthermore, we can make assumptions about the parameters defining the baseline trajectory (e.g., level and slope) and the change in trajectory with treatment (e.g., the change in level and change in slope)—they either differ across cases within the study, or we can assume that some of these parameters are the same across cases. Purposeful consideration of our included SCDs is likely to lead to more accurate effect size estimation. If we do not select a structural model consistent with our data, we can expect biased design-comparable effect size estimates. Figure 2.2: Multiple Baseline Across Participants (Rodgers et al., 2020) As an example, we present the study of a writing intervention for post-secondary adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities that targeted the improvement of sentence construction (Rodgers et al., 2021). Figure 2.2 is a graphical depiction of the study design and outcome data. Visual analysis of the baseline phases suggests potential baseline trends in accurate writing sequences. Therefore, it would be appropriate to specify a model that assumes a trend in baseline. For participant Denny, our visual analysis of observed correct writing sequences suggests an increasing baseline trend, represented by the solid line in Figure 2.3 (estimated using ordinary least squares regression). In contrast, if we selected a baseline model assuming no trend, Denny’s projected baseline of no trend is considerably different than the projected baseline assuming a linear trend. (In Figure 2.3, note the difference between the dotted lines representing the baseline trends projected through the treatment phase). The effect estimate would be larger if we did not model the baseline trend in Figure 2.3 because the observed treatment values are further above the projection based on no trend than the projection based on trend. Thus, assumptions about trends have consequences for the effect size estimates. Figure 2.3: Hypothesized and Projected Baselines for Denny (Rodgers et al., 2020) To select an appropriate structural model, we recommend that meta-analysts start by carefully considering the discipline or intervention under study for the research synthesis, including but not limited to the outcome of interest, the participants included in the studies, and what prior research says about what can be expected regarding trends in absence of intervention and data trends in the treatment phase. For example, a review of research on the use of positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS) over time show some efficacy in the reduction of both in-school and out-of-school student suspensions for Black students and students with disabilities (see Gage et al., 2020 for a review). Using this as a basis for understanding the nature of the interventions, contexts, and populations, we can reasonably assume future PBIS research would report similar responses to the interventions if the research contexts are similar. However, rather than make such a broad assumption without verifying it, we recommend that meta-analysts visually analyze all data for studies included in the synthesis and consider the degree to which the data from the studies are reasonably consistent with prior expectations. If data from the studies are consistent with trend expectations (e.g., a learning curve associated with the development of a new skill), these assumptions can be used to select among the design-comparable effect size modeling options. Misalignment between a priori assumptions and actual observations across the studies’ included data is likely to compromise the degree of confidence that we place in estimating effect sizes. If substantial inconsistencies exist between researchers’ expectations for and actual observations of study data, results from any single modeling option become more suspect. In these situations, we encourage researchers to estimate the effects for each of the competing sets of trend assumptions to provide information on the sensitivity of the findings to the modeling decisions. 2.5 Modeling Options for Design-comparable Effect Size Estimation After meta-analysts consider the tenability of the exchangeability assumption, we suggest consideration of normality and homogeneity of variance assumptions. If violations to these distributional assumptions are severe, researchers should reconsider whether the SCD and group design study outcomes are similar enough to assume exchangeability and warrant synthesis using the standardized mean difference effect size metric. If outcomes are substantially different across design types, it may be more reasonable to meta-analyze the SCD and group design studies separately and to use a different effect size metric for the SCD studies. When outcomes appear more similar and violations are not too severe, we suggest meta-analysts proceed with the design-comparable effect sizes and note findings. In their decision to proceed with design-comparable effect sizes, researchers should describe the range of characteristics of the SCD as well as the predominant SCD used in the area of synthesis. For example, do most SCD studies in the research area tend to use reversal designs (e.g., ABAB designs) or do studies predominantly use designs of multiple baseline and/or multiple probe across participants? When synthesizing reversal designs with design-comparable effect sizes, researchers are currently limited to models that assume stability (i.e., no trend). For multiple baseline or multiple probe designs, a variety of trend assumptions are feasible such as linear or quadratic. When the synthesis includes predominantly multiple baseline and/or multiple probe designs, researchers should state their expectations about trends given their understanding of the participants, context, and outcome under study. We also recommend they visually inspect the graphs of the data from the primary studies, analyzing them for consistency with the trend expectations. Based on these considerations, it is helpful to determine which of the following sets of trend assumptions are most reasonable for the set of studies to be synthesized: (a) no trends in baseline or treatment phases, (b) no trends in baseline, but trends in treatment phases, or (c) trends in baseline and differential trends in treatment. After clarifying the trend assumptions, researchers next need to clarify assumptions about variability in treatment effect across cases (e.g., Is the treatment effect expected to be the same for each case or are between-participant differences anticipated in the response to intervention?). Again, we rely heavily on logic models for the area of research and visual analyses of primary study data to determine if these data are reasonably consistent with the expectations. Figure 2.4 arranges these considerations into a series of decision rules that researchers can use to select from one of six common models for design-comparable effect sizes. Although there are other possibilities for specifying a design-comparable effect size estimation model, these six models cover a wide range of scenarios that can be estimated with the scdhlm software application (Pustejovsky et al., 2021). In addition, we included models that have received the most attention in the methodological literature, as well as those that have been applied in meta-analyses of single-case data.

We provide step-by-step instructions to demonstrate the selection and estimation of design-comparable effect sizes, using two multiple baseline studies, a replicated ABAB study, and a group design study. We use the scdhlm app to show how to estimate the design-comparable effect sizes for the single-case studies and discuss estimating the effect size for the group study. Then, we illustrate how to combine the effects using a fixed effect meta-analysis. In this chapter, we illustrate the computation of design-comparable effect sizes based on models that do not include time trends (i.e., Models 1 and 2 in Figure 2.4). These models assume that the dependent variable has a stable level throughout the baseline phase for each case and that introduction of treatment leads to an immediate shift in the level of the dependent variable. In this chapter, we pretend we are researchers who want to synthesize evidence from several single-case design (SCD) and group design studies that examine intervention effects on the improvement of math problem solving for students with disabilities. To model the process succinctly, we limit our illustration to four included studies comprised of two multiple baseline designs, a replicated ABAB design, and one group design. In one of the SCDs, Peltier et al. (2020) used a multiple baseline design across three small groups to examine the effect of a mathematics intervention for 12 students struggling with mathematical word problems. In another SCD study, Case et al. (1992) used a multiple baseline design across four students with math word problem solving difficulties to examine the impact of a mathematics intervention. The third SCD study by Lambert et al. (2006) used an ABAB design replicated across nine participants with disruptive behaviors from two classrooms to examine intervention effects on math problem solving. The fourth included study by Hutchinson (1993) used a group design where students with learning disabilities were randomly assigned to intervention and control conditions and students’ math word problem solving accuracy was measured pre- and post-intervention. Because our goal is to aggregate effects across single-case and group design studies, we consider design-comparable effect sizes (see the decision rules in Figure 1.1). We break down this illustration into four stages: (1) selecting a design-comparable effect size for the SCD studies, (2) estimating the design-comparable effect size for the SCD studies using the scdhlm app (Pustejovsky et al., 2021), which is a web-based calculator for design-comparable effect sizes, (3) estimating the effect size for the group study, and (4) synthesizing the effect sizes across the included studies. We concentrate primarily on the first two steps, because well-developed methods for group studies are illustrated in detail elsewhere (e.g., Borenstein et al. (2021); H. Cooper et al. (2019); Hedges (1981); Hedges (2007)). 3.1 Selecting a Design-Comparable Effect Size for the Single-Case Studies We first select an appropriate design-comparable effect size using the decision rules in Figure 1.1. To formulate hypotheses about potential trends in baseline and/or treatment phases (i.e., if and why we expect those trends), we rely on previous experience and existing knowledge of the population, study contexts, and outcome of interest. Based on such, we assume that students in the studies would not improve mathematics skills without intervention. We also expect the interventions to abruptly change the outcomes, so we anticipate an immediate shift in the level of performance from baseline to treatment and no trend in the treatment phase. Finally, because we assume no trends in either baseline or treatment phases, we tentatively consider Model 1 or Model 2 from Figure 1.1. These models are the only options for the ABAB design and are appropriate for multiple baseline designs when not anticipating trends. Ideally, we make the choice between Model 1 and Model 2 based on our conceptual understanding and our a priori expectation that either the treatment effect would not vary from case to case (i.e., Model 1) or would vary from one case to the next (Model 2). Due to the participants’ differential learning histories and existing skills or abilities, we anticipate some variation in the effect across cases. We tentatively select Model 2 as the best fit, as it is most consistent with our understanding of this context. To verify the tenability of our assumptions, we conduct a visual analysis of the SCD study graphs. We present the data extracted from each SCD study, with data from Case et al. (1992) shown in Figure 3.1, Peltier et al. (2020) data in Figure 3.2, and data extracted from Lambert et al. (2006) in Figure 3.3. Prior to examining the data to evaluate its consistency with the Model 2 trend assumptions, we consider whether the data are reasonably aligned with the homogeneity and normality assumptions underlying all design-comparable effect size models. Note that in Figures 3.1 and 3.2, we generally see similar variation from one case to the next, and similar within-case variation across phases. We also fail to see any outliers that would call into question the normality assumption. However, in Figure 3.3, there is a tendency for the treatment phases to have more variability than the baseline phases. Further, in Figure 3.3, all observations for Student A4 have values near zero in the first baseline phase—inconsistent with our homogeneity and normality assumptions. Although it appears that some of the design-comparable effect size assumptions were violated, we proceed because the violations appear relatively minor and our combining effect sizes across single-case and group studies requires that we compute a design-comparable effect size for each study (or drop the study from the synthesis). Next, given the data observed in the primary studies, we consider if a model absent of baseline trends appears reasonable. Across the cases in Figures 3.1-3.3, the typical baseline pattern is one of no trend and is consistent with our expectations. However, there are a few exceptions. In Figure 3.1, Ben’s data appear to have an upward baseline trend with observed values of 2, 2, and 3. This visual trend is ambiguous; it could be an artifact of Ben just happening to solve one more math problem on Day 3 (i.e., chance). Yet, based on our previously stated expectations and an absence of baseline improvement for the other participants, we find it more reasonable to assume that Ben would continue to solve two or three problems per session (i.e., no trend) as opposed to continuing to improve by about one problem per day (i.e., linear trend). The former assumption is also consistent with the decision made by Case et al. (1992) to intervene with Ben. In other words, had the researchers thought Ben’s math problem solving was improving in baseline, there would be less reason for Ben to receive the intervention. We also consider other case examples. In Figure 3.2, Gary’s data appear to have an upward baseline trend and Kyrie’s data appear to have a downward trend in baseline. These trends are inconsistent with each other, and with the typical pattern seen across the Peltier et al. (2020) study cases. As with Ben (see Figure 3.1), we are not confident that the apparent trend would continue. If Gary’s trend were to continue, there would be no need for intervention. If Kyrie’s trend were to continue, we would predict negative percentages correct in the upcoming sessions, which is not possible. Thus, we proceed with the assumption of no baseline trend because the typical pattern for most cases in each study is consistent with our expectations of no trend, and because of the ambiguity surrounding the few possible exceptions. Next, focusing on the treatment phases, we conduct similar analyses. In Figures 3.1 and 3.3, where there is an immediate shift in performance and no trend in the treatment phases, we find patterns that match our hypothesized treatment trend expectations. In Figure 3.2, we again see a typical pattern where the shift in performance is immediate and stable over time. While here there are a few exceptions where cases appear to have a decline in performance toward the end of the intervention phase (e.g., Andy and Ellie), we find it best to select a model consistent with the typical and expected pattern. We proceed with a model that assumes no trend in baseline and treatment phases (i.e., Model 1 or Model 2 from Figure 2.4) because the design-comparable effect sizes assume a common model across cases and estimate an average effect across cases. Figure 3.1: Multiple Baseline Data Extracted from Case et al. (1992) Figure 3.2: Multiple Baseline Data Extracted from Peltier et al. (2020) Figure 3.3: Replicated ABAB Data Extracted from Lambert et al. (2006) 3.2 Details of the No Trend Models for Design-Comparable Effect Sizes To fully differentiate between Model 1 and Model 2, we present the formal specification of each. For both Model 1 and Model 2, we can write the within-case model as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.1} Y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}Tx_{ij} + e_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Y_ij\\) is the score on the outcome variable \\(Y\\) at measurement occasion \\(i\\) for case \\(j\\), and \\(Tx_{ij}\\) is dummy coded with a value of 0 for baseline observations and a value of 1 for the treatment phase observations. The mean baseline level for case \\(j\\) is \\(\\beta_{0j}\\) (see Figure 3.4 for a visual representation of \\(\\beta_{0j}\\) and \\(\\beta_{1j}\\)). The raw score treatment effect for case \\(j\\) is indexed by \\(\\beta_{1j}\\), which is the difference between the treatment phase outcome mean and the baseline phase mean. The error (\\(e_{ij}\\)) is time- and case-specific and assumed normally distributed and first-order autoregressive with variance \\(\\sigma_e^2\\). Figure 3.4: Illustration of Treatment Effect for Asher (Peltier et al., 2020) For Model 1, the between-case model is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.2} \\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + u_{0j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.3} \\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\gamma_{00}\\) is the across-case average baseline mean and \\(u_{0j}\\) is a case-specific error, which is the deviation from the overall average for case \\(j\\). We assume the error is normally distributed with variance \\(\\sigma_{u_0}^2\\). We assume the across-case average raw score treatment effect, \\(\\gamma_{10}\\), to be constant for all cases. Thus, there is no error term in the equation for \\(\\beta_{1j}\\). Based on this model, the design-comparable effect size is defined as the average raw score treatment effect (\\(\\gamma_{10}\\)) divided by a SD that is comparable to the SD used to standardize mean differences in group-design studies (Pustejovsky et al., 2014): \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.4} \\delta = \\frac{\\gamma_{10}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{u_0}^2 + \\sigma_e^2}} \\end{equation}\\] The Model 2 specification is like Model 1, with the only difference being an error term (\\(u_{1j}\\)) added to Equation (3.3) to account for between-case variation in the treatment effect. More specifically: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.5} Y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}Tx_{ij} + e_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.6} \\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + u_{0j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{3.7} \\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} + u_{1j} \\end{equation}\\] Again, the across-case average baseline mean is \\(\\gamma_{00}\\) and the across-case average raw score treatment effect (i.e., difference in treatment and baseline phase means) is \\(\\gamma_{10}\\). The case-specific errors (\\(u_{0j}\\) and \\(u_{1j}\\)) account for between-case differences in baseline level and response to treatment. They are assumed multivariate normal with covariance \\(\\Sigma_u = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{u_0}^2 &amp; \\\\ \\sigma_{u_1u_0} &amp; \\sigma_{u_1}^2 \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\). We define the design-comparable effect size exactly as in Equation (3.4), because the effect size is scaled by the SD of the outcome in the absence of intervention and not dependent on the addition of \\(u_{1j}\\), which only impacts between-case variance in the treatment phase. Because we tentatively selected Model 2 based on our a priori considerations, we use it to illustrate the estimation of design-comparable effect sizes for this data set. For several reasons, we also contrast the Model 2 results to what we obtain from Model 1. First, contrasting Model 1 and 2 results provides us with an additional way to examine the empirical support for our model selection. For instance, we could report that visual analyses of the model-implied individual trajectories for Model 2 fit the raw data better than the model implied individual trajectories from Model 1. Second, the contrast allows us to examine the sensitivity of our effect size estimates to the model chosen. For instance, this contrast may lead us to rule out between-case effect size variation as having a large impact on the estimated design-comparable effect size. Finally, contrasting allows us to illustrate a method of selecting between models in circumstances where a priori information is not sufficient. 3.3 Estimating the Design-Comparable Effect Size for the Single-Case Studies 3.3.1 Example 1: Multiple Baseline Study by Case et al. (1992) We can estimate design-comparable effect sizes for all models suggested in Figure 3.4, using a web-based calculator for design-comparable effect sizes (scdhlm; Pustejovsky et al. (2021)). The scdhlm app is available at https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/scdhlm/. To use this app, researchers must store their dataset in an Excel file (.xlsx), comma delimited file (.csv), or text file (.txt). In addition, we recommend that users inspect their data to ensure the inclusion of the following variables: case identifier, phase identifier, session number, and the outcome. Although not required, researchers may want to arrange the data columns by order of variable appearance in the app. We show this arrangement for the Case et al. (1992) study in Figure (fig:Excel-Case-1992). There, we demonstrate the following order of column headers with case identifier representing data in the first column, followed by variables in this order (left-to-right): phase identifier, session number, and the outcomes in the fourth column. Researchers have the flexibility to use any labeling scheme that clearly distinguishes between baseline and intervention conditions. For example, for the phase identifier, one can use \\(b\\) or 0 to indicate baseline observations and \\(i\\) or 1 to indicate intervention observations. However, the app requires that numerical values be used for both session number and outcome. Finally, we recommend that users arrange the data first by case (i.e., enter all the rows of data for the first case before any of the rows of data for the second case) and then by session number. Figure 3.5: Illustration of Treatment Effect for Asher (Peltier et al., 2020) After starting the app, we use the Load tab to load the data file, as illustrated in Figure (fig:Load-Case-1992). As mentioned previously, the data file can be a .txt or .csv file that includes one dataset, or an Excel (.xlsx) file that has either one (e.g., a data set for one study) or multiple spreadsheets (one spreadsheet for each of several studies). If using a .xlsx file with multiple spreadsheets, the scdhlm app allows us to select the spreadsheet containing the data for the study of interest from the Load tab. Then, we use the drop-down menus on the right of the screen to indicate the study design (treatment reversal versus Multiple Baseline/Multiple Probe across participants) and which variables in the data set correspond to the case identifier, phase identifier, session, and outcome (see Figure (fig:Load-Case-1992)). Figure 3.6: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Load Tab After loading our data, we use the Inspect tab to ensure the accurate import of raw data into the app and assigned variable names are accurate (Figure (fig:Inspect-Case-1992)). In addition, we can use the Inspect tab to view a graph of the data (Figure (fig:Graph-Case-1992)). We recommend that researchers compare these data with the graphed data from the original studies to ensure accuracy in uploading the data and specifying the design and variable names on the Load tab. Check the graphed data again for consistency with the (tentatively) selected model for the design-comparable effect size. Figure 3.7: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Data Tab within Inspect Tab for Case et al. (1992) Figure 3.8: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Graph Tab Within Inspect Tab for Case et al. (1992) After inspecting the data, we next specify the model for the design-comparable effect size using the Model tab. Figure 3.9 shows our specification for Model 2 (i.e., the model that assumes no trends and an effect that varies across cases). The specification process begins with the selection of trend type for the baseline phase. For this example, under Type of time trend, we select level because we assume no time trends in the baseline phases. Then, we opt to include level as a fixed effect and check the box to enable the model estimation of the average baseline level (i.e., \\(\\gamma_{00}\\) from Equation (3.6). We also include level as a random effect, so that the baseline level can vary from case to case. Focusing on the treatment phase next, we select change in level as the Type of time trend, because we assume that the treatment will only change the level of the outcome (not trend) and include change in level as a fixed effect. As a fixed effect, we can obtain an estimate of the average shift in level between baseline and treatment phases (i.e., \\(\\gamma_{10}\\) from Equation (3.7). Finally, we choose to include change in level as a random effect to allow the change in level (i.e., treatment effect) to vary from case to case. Note the scdhlm app allows us to make different potential assumptions about the correlation structure of the session-level errors. Shown in Figure 3.9 are the default options of auto-regautoregressive and constant variance across phases. These defaults match the model presented in Equation (3.1). At this point, our model for the design-comparable effect size matches Model 2 from Figure 2.4. At the bottom of the screen, the scdhlm app provides a graph of the data with trend lines based on the specified model. We recommend that users inspect this graph to ensure that the trend lines fit the data reasonably well. If the trend lines do not fit the data well, a question about model selection arises. For example, we find the baseline trend line for Abernathy is relatively high compared to their actual baseline observations. However, other model specifications (e.g., Model 1 shown later) did not improve the fit of Abernathy’s baseline trend line. So, we decide to proceed with estimation because most other trend lines look appropriate, and the model is consistent with our a priori expectations. Throughout this process, researchers should maintain a high standard for transparency in decision-making when reporting methods and results. Figure 3.9: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model Tab Showing Model 2 Specification for Case et al. (1992) For the Case et al. (1992) data set, the a priori-identified Model 2 provides trajectories that fit the data reasonably well1. Thus, we proceed to the Effect size tab. As shown in Figure 3.10, the estimated design-comparable effect size for this study is 2.57 with a standard error (SE) of 0.45 and \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval (CI) [1.65, 3.50]. Additional information reported on the Effect size tab include estimates of other quantities from the model, information about the model specification, and the assumed time-points used in calculating the design-comparable effect size. The reported degrees of freedom are used in making a small-sample correction to the effect size estimate, analogous to the Hedges’ g correction used with group designs (Hedges, 1981). Larger estimated degrees of freedom imply more precision in estimating the denominator of the design-comparable effect size, making the small-sample correction less consequential. Conversely, smaller degrees of freedom are indicative of imprecise design-comparable effect size denominator estimation, making the small-sample correction more consequential. The Effect size tab, shown in 3.10, also reports autocorrelation, which is the estimate of the correlation between level-1 errors of the model for the same case, differing by one time point (i.e., session) based on a first-order autoregressive model. Given the selected follow-up time, the reported intra-class correlation is an estimate of the between-case variance of the outcome as a proportion of the total variation in the outcome (including both between-case and within-case variance). Larger values of the intra-class correlation indicate that more of the variation in the outcome is between participants. The remaining output information (Study design, Estimation method, Baseline specification, Treatment specification, Initial treatment time, Follow-up time) describe the model specification and assumptions used in the effect size calculations. The scdhlm app includes such to allow for reproducibility of the calculations. Figure 3.10: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Effect size Tab Showing Model 2 Estimate for Case et al. (1992) If our a priori arguments for selecting Model 2 were weak, or we wanted to consider Model 1, we can easily compute the results of a different model by going back to the Model tab and changing our specification. The only difference is that Model 1 does not include change in level as a random effect for the treatment phase. For illustration purposes, we present Model 1 specification results for this study in Figure 3.11. As before, we keep the level option selected as the Type of time trend for the baseline phase, as both a fixed effect and a random effect. In the treatment phase, we keep change in level as the Type of time trend but select only change in level as a fixed effect. The Model 1 trend lines fit similarly to those from Model 2; the Model 1 design-comparable effect size is 2.59 with an SE of 0.41 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [1.76, 3.42]. This suggests that the effect size estimate is not sensitive to our decision about whether the treatment effect varies across cases. Despite this information, we proceed with the Model 2 estimate because it is consistent with our expectations for the research in this area. Figure 3.11: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model Tab Showing Model 1 Specification for Case et al. (1992) 3.3.2 Example 2: Multiple Baseline Study by Peltier et al. (2020) We now have a design-comparable effect size for the first single-case study by Case et al. (1992). Next, we repeat these steps for all other SCD studies in our synthesis. For this illustration, we include a second multiple baseline study (Peltier et al., 2020). For this second study, we ran through the same sequence of steps: 1. load the data; 2. inspect the data in both tabular and graphic form; 3. specify our selected model for the data (i.e., Model 2 for this illustration); and 4. estimate the design-comparable effect size. After performing these steps, we found that the estimated model trajectories for the Model 2 specification fit the Peltier et al. (2020) data well, as shown in Figure 3.12. For the Peltier et al. (2020) study, the design-comparable effect size is 2.95 with an SE of 0.28 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [2.42, 3.53]. We then estimated the effect for Model 1 (i.e., we remove the check next to change in level under include random effect), which is the more restrictive model that does not allow the treatment effect to vary across cases. Model 1 produced a design-comparable effect size estimate of 2.83 with an SE of 0.24 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [2.34, 3.31], like the Model 2 design-comparable effect size. Figure 3.12: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model 2 Specification for Peltier et al. (2020) 3.3.3 Example 3: Replicated ABAB Design by Lambert et al. (2006) For the third SCD study, we illustrate use of the scdhlm app using data from a replicated ABAB design by Lambert et al. (2006). As with the previous two SCD studies, we load our spreadsheet containing the study data in the usual manner. However, unlike Case et al. (1992) and Peltier et al. (2020), the Lambert et al. (2006) study does not utilize a multiple baseline design. Therefore, on the right side of the Load tab, using the drop-down menu under Please specify the study design, we must select Treatment Reversal (as opposed to Multiple baseline/Multiple probe across participants). After loading the data, we again use the Inspect tab to visually inspect the data in both tabular and graphic form. Then using the Model tab (shown in Figure 3.13), we continue to specify Model 2 by checking the option under the Baseline phase to include level as both a fixed effect and a random effect and checking under the Treatment phase to include change in level as both a fixed effect and a random effect. Users of the app will note that for reversal designs, there is no drop-down menu from which they can potentially add trends (i.e., level is the only option for baseline specification, and change in level is the only option for treatment phase specification). This makes specification using the Model tab simpler than in our previous examples of multiple baseline studies, although it does also constrain the user’s ability to specify a well-fitting model. On the Model tab, we see that the fitted trajectories fit these data well. After specifying the model, we view the Effect size tab to obtain the design-comparable effect size (see Figure 3.13). For Lambert et al. (2006), the estimated Model 2 design-comparable effect size is 6.37 with an SE of 0.39 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [5.60, 7.14]. Like the previous SCD studies, we also estimate the effect for Model 1, which is the more restrictive model that does not allow the treatment effect to vary across cases. Model 1 produces an estimate of 6.34 with an SE of 0.37 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [5.61, 7.08], a similar result to the Model 2 design-comparable effect size. Figure 3.13: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model 2 Specification for Lambert et al. (2006) 3.4 Estimating the Design-Comparable Effect Size for the Group Studies After estimating the design-comparable effect size for each SCD study, we turn our attention to estimating the design-comparable effect size for each group study. Hutchinson (1993) used random assignment of individual students with learning disabilities to either the intervention (\\(n = 12\\)) or control (\\(n = 8\\)) conditions. After intervention, both groups of students completed 25 math word problems selected from the British Columbia Mathematics Achievement Test. Because details for estimating standardized mean difference effect sizes from group studies are readily available from a variety of sources including chapters (Borenstein, 2019), books (e.g., Borenstein et al., 2021) and journal articles (Hedges, 1981; e.g., Hedges, 2007), we do not model the calculation procedures and simply report the results. Using the Hutchinson (1993) group design study summary statistics at posttest, we calculate a standardized mean difference in math word problem solving as 0.71, with an SE of 0.45 based on Hedges’ g to correct for small-sample bias. 3.5 Analyzing the Effect Sizes After we have obtained effect sizes from each single-case and group study, we can proceed with synthesizing the effect sizes. Depending on our synthesis goals, we have a variety of tools and approaches available. We can: (a) create graphical displays (e.g., forest plots) to show the effect size for each study along with their confidence interval, (b) average the effect sizes and create a confidence interval for the overall average effect, (c) estimate the extent of variation in effects across studies, (d) examine the effect sizes for evidence of publication bias, and (e) explore potential moderators of the effect. Since the use of design-comparable effect sizes for the SCD studies produce estimates having the same metric as the commonly used standardized mean difference effect sizes from group studies, researchers can accomplish these goals (e.g., averaging the effect sizes or running a moderator analysis) using methods developed for group studies. Details on these methods are readily available elsewhere (e.g., Borenstein et al., 2021; H. Cooper et al., 2019). We illustrate the averaging of the effect sizes from our studies here using a fixed effect meta-analysis, so that this illustration is consistent with the approach used in What Works Clearinghouse intervention reports (What Works Clearinghouse, 2020b). Table 3.1 reports the effect size estimates, SEs, and fixed effect meta-analysis calculations for our four included studies. In fixed effect meta-analysis, the overall average effect size estimate is a weighted average of the effect size estimates from the individual studies, with weights proportional to the inverse of the sampling variance (squared SE) of each effect size estimate. Further, the SE of the overall effect size is the square root of the inverse of the total weight. In Table 3.1, column C reports the inverse variance weight assigned to each study, with the percentage of the total weight listed in parentheses. For instance, the effect size estimate from Peltier et al. (2020) receives 43.7% of the total weight, while the effect size estimates from Case et al. (1992) and Hutchinson (1993) each receive 16.9% of the total weight. The total inverse variance weight is 29.21. The overall average effect size estimate is 3.28 with an SE of 0.18 and an approximate \\(95\\%\\) CI [2.91, 3.64]. The Q-test for heterogeneity is highly significant, Q(3) = 99.3, p &lt; .0001, indicating that the included effect size estimates are more variable than we would expect due to sampling error alone. In other words, it is unlikely that we would observe such a wide dispersion of effect size estimates if the studies were all estimating the same true effect size parameter. Table 3.1: Fixed Effect Meta-Analysis Calculations for Example Math Invervention Studies Study Effect Size Estimate (A) Standard Error (B) Inverse-variance Weight (%) (C) Case et al. (1992) 2.57 0.45 4.94 (16.9) Peltier et al. (2020) 2.95 0.28 12.76 (43.7) Lambert et al. (2006) 6.37 0.39 6.57 (22.5) Hutchinson (1993) 0.71 0.45 4.94 (16.9) Fixed effect meta-analysis 3.28 0.19 29.21 (100) In fixed effect meta-analysis, the overall average effect size estimate is a summary of the effect size estimates across the included studies, where studies are treated as fixed. Therefore, the SE and CI in fixed effect meta-analysis account for the uncertainty in the process of effect size estimation that occurs in each of the individual studies. However, they do not account for uncertainty in the process of identifying studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis (Konstantopoulos &amp; Hedges, 2019; Rice et al., 2018), nor do they provide a basis for generalization beyond the included studies. When conducting syntheses of larger bodies of literature—and especially of studies with heterogeneous populations, design features, or dependent effect sizes—researchers will often prefer to use random effects models (Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998) or their further extensions (Pustejovsky &amp; Tipton, 2021; Van den Noortgate et al., 2013). Of the studies we use as illustrative examples in this chapter, the dependent variable of the group study (Hutchinson, 1993) was the broadest. Conversely, the Case et al. (1992) and Peltier et al. (2020) MB studies used more narrowly defined dependent variables. Finally, we note the outcome from the replicated ABAB design (Lambert et al., 2006) included a behavioral component (i.e., it is not purely academic). In a synthesis of many studies, researchers might use moderator analysis (i.e., meta-regression analysis) to explore the extent to which variation in effect size is related to dependent variable characteristics or other study features. Methods for conducting such moderator analysis are described elsewhere (Borenstein et al., 2021, Chapters 19–21; Konstantopoulos &amp; Hedges, 2019). References Borenstein, M. (2019).

Using data from two multiple baseline studies and a group study, we provide step-by-step instructions for selecting design-comparable effect sizes for the single-case studies and estimating them using the scdhlm app. We also briefly discuss estimating the effect size for the group study and synthesizing the effect sizes across the single-case and group and design studies. In this chapter, we demonstrate the computation of design-comparable effect sizes using models with trends in the treatment phase(s) online (i.e., no baseline trend), as represented by Models 3 and 4 in Figure 2.4. These models assume that: (a) baseline observations of the dependent variable for each case occur at a stable level and (b) intervention leads to a change in both level and trajectory or growth rate in the treatment phase. Let us consider a hypothetical scenario where we are interested in synthesizing single-case design (SCD) and group design studies that report intervention effects for reducing the amount of time it takes individuals to fall asleep at night (i.e., sleep onset latency). For purposes of illustration, we consider a review comprised of just three studies, including two multiple baseline designs and one group design. The first SCD study (Delemere &amp; Dounavi, 2018) investigated the effects of two parent-implemented interventions (positive routines versus fading routines) on reducing sleep onset latency for six child participants with autism. Our second included SCD study, Gunning &amp; Espie (2003), evaluated the effects of a sleep intervention on reducing the sleep latency of seven adult participants with intellectual disabilities. Our third study, a group design by Montgomery (2004), compared the efficacy of two sleep intervention delivery methods (face-to-face or booklet) for 66 children with learning disabilities (aged 2–8 years) randomly assigned to either treatment or waitlist control groups. We recommend that researchers use the decision rules in Figure 1.1 to select a method to estimate and synthesize effects, and to consider design-comparable effect sizes when the purpose is to aggregate effects across SCD and group design studies. For Models 3 and 4 and using the aforementioned set of studies for our hypothetical synthesis, we break down the process of model selection and estimation into four steps: 1. Selecting a design-comparable effect size for the SCD studies. 2. Estimating the design-comparable effect size for the SCD studies using the scdhlm app (Pustejovsky et al., 2021). 3. Estimating the effect sizes for the group studies. 4. Synthesizing the effect sizes across single-case and group studies. We focus on the first two steps because guidance and illustrations of methods for group studies are readily available from other sources (Borenstein et al., 2021; H. Cooper et al., 2019). 4.1 Selecting a Design-Comparable Effect Size for the Single-Case Studies We begin by using the decision rules in Figure 2.4 to guide our selection of an appropriate design-comparable effect size. Across the studies, we use our knowledge of the population, context, and outcome of interest to inform any assumptions about the presence or absence of trends in either baseline and/or treatment phases. For our included studies, we assume that all participants generally have stable but high levels of behavior impeding a healthy nighttime routine (e.g., long latency to onset of sleep, frequent nighttime awakenings, etc.). We also assume no therapeutic trend in the baseline phase for each participant because otherwise there would be no need for the participants to receive the intervention. Further, we postulate that intervention will result in improved sleep behavior over time, as noted by a reduction in sleep problems in the treatment phase. Because we predict trend in only the treatment phase but not the baseline phase, we tentatively consider using Model 3 or Model 4 (see Figure 2.4). Ideally, we would make the choice between Model 3 and Model 4 based on a logic model and a priori expectation of treatment effect variation (or lack thereof) within and across cases. For example, if we hypothesize that treatment effects do not vary from one case to the next, we will specify our design-comparable effect size using Model 3. Alternatively, if we assume that effects do vary across cases, we will use Model 4. For this synthesis, we note that all studies investigated sleep problems in the context of a participant’s own home. Furthermore, primary caregivers delivered the interventions, and we assume they have different learning histories and backgrounds. Therefore, we believe it is reasonable to anticipate some variation in the effect across cases and tentatively select Model 4. The next step in the selection of design-comparable effect sizes for SCDs requires us to conduct visual inspection of each SCD study graph to see if our trend assumptions hold. We extracted data from the Delemere &amp; Dounavi (2018) study and present the multiple baseline across participant graphs in Figure 4.1 (three participants who received the bedtime fading intervention) and Figure 4.2 (three participants who received the positive routines intervention). In Figure 4.3, we extracted data from the Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) study and present the multiple baseline design graph for the seven participants with the target outcome of reducing sleep onset. When visually analyzing the graphs, we consider whether the data are reasonably consistent with the homogeneity and normality assumptions underlying any of the models for design-comparable effect sizes. In Figures 4.1-4.3, we observe similar variation between cases and variation across phases within each case and conclude that the assumption of homogeneous level-1 variance is tenable. In addition, we find no severe outlying data to suggest clear departures from non-normality. Therefore, our initial decision to use design-comparable effect sizes appears appropriate. Figure 4.1: Multiple Baseline Data for Martin, Alan, and John (Delemere &amp; Dounavi, 2018) Figure 4.2: Multiple Baseline Data for Niahm, Mary, and Thomas (Delemere &amp; Dounavi, 2018) Figure 4.3: Multiple Baseline Design Data from 7 Participants with the Target Outcome of Reducing Sleep Onset Latency (Gunning &amp; Espie, 2003) Next, for our included studies, we consider the appropriateness of Models 3 and 4 that assume no trends in baseline. Visual inspection of the participants’ graphs in Figure 4.1 (Delemere &amp; Dounavi, 2018) appears to reinforce our assumption of no trend in baseline data. Similarly, as shown in Figure 4.3 (Gunning &amp; Espie, 2003), sleep onset latency neither increased nor decreased in the baseline condition for most participants. However, there are some exceptions to baseline stability observed. In Figure 4.3, Case D appears to show some improvement during baseline. In Figure 4.2, Niahm, Mary, and Thomas appear to have worsening sleep problems during the baseline phase. These trends are inconsistent with the typical pattern seen across cases in Figures 4.1 and 4.3. Whether there are truly trends that would continue is questionable. Perhaps the trends are artifacts related to fidelity or reliability of parental data collection, and thus would not continue. In similar situations, we recommend that researchers reflect upon and reconsider their model selection. Using this specific example, it seems odd to assume that simply enrolling in a study would affect sleep patterns well established within the participant’s home routine. Rather, we find it more reasonable to assume that sleep onset latency for individuals with disabilities would vary around an average level across baseline observations. Therefore, we proceed with Model 4 because most cases in the included studies have baseline data consistent with the expectation of no trend, and because of the ambiguity and questions surrounding the few possible exceptions. We proceed with visual inspection of observations in the treatment phase after examining baseline phase observations. Across most cases, we note an immediate change in the time it takes participants to fall asleep and a downward trend in treatment phase observations. While there are a few exceptions where participants appear to respond immediately to intervention, the downward trend does not continue across the remainder of the treatment phase (e.g., see Niahm, Mary, and Thomas in Figure 4.2). Because the design-comparable effect size assumes a common model across cases and estimates an average effect across the cases, we find it best to select a model that is consistent with the typical and expected pattern. Thus, it appears reasonable to proceed with a model that assumes no trend in baseline conditions and a trend in the treatment phase (i.e., Model 3 or Model 4 from Figure 2.4. 4.2 Details of the Models for Design-Comparable Effect Sizes To appreciate how the treatment effect is defined in Models 3 and 4, let us examine the models in more detail. For both Model 3 and Model 4, we can write the within-case model as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.1} Y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}Tx_{ij} + \\beta_{2j}Tx_{ij}\\times(Time_{ij}-k_j-D) + e_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Y_{ij}\\) is the score on the outcome variable \\(Y\\) at measurement occasion \\(i\\) for case \\(j\\), \\(Tx_{ij}\\) is dummy coded with a value of \\(0\\) for baseline observations and a value of \\(1\\) for the treatment phase observations, \\(k_j\\) is the last time-point before case \\(j\\) enters the treatment phase, and \\(D\\) is a centering constant that defines the focal time for indexing the treatment effect. The raw score treatment effect for case \\(j\\) is indexed by \\(\\beta_{1j}\\), which is the distance between the treatment phase trend line and the baseline mean at the time where \\((Time_{ij}-k_j-D)=0\\). In Figure 4.4, we portray the raw score treatment effect for Martin at a time of 5 observations into treatment. If we set \\(D&lt;5\\), the focal treatment effect would be smaller; if we set \\(D&gt;5\\), the focal treatment effect would be larger. The other coefficients of the within-case model are \\(\\beta_{0j}\\), which is the mean level of the outcome during baseline for case \\(j\\), and \\(\\beta_{2j}\\), which is the slope of the treatment phase trend line for case \\(j\\). The error (\\(e_{ij}\\)) is time-specific and case-specific and assumed normally distributed and first-order autoregressive with variance \\(\\sigma_e^2\\). Figure 4.4: Martin’s Treatment Effect Five Observations into Treatment (Delemere &amp; Dounavi, 2018) Because the effect varies over time in the treatment phase and we estimate it at a specific focal time (i.e., when \\((Time_{ij}-k_j-D)=0\\)), it is important for us to consider what focal time we should select. For example, is it better to estimate the effect at the beginning of the treatment phase or between 3-10 observations into the treatment phase? Researchers should carefully consider their focal time selection by examining patterns in the typical treatment phase length in each SCD and group design study. For example, we chose to estimate the effect for the SCD studies 10 observations into the treatment phase for two reasons. First, 10 observations into treatment is closely aligned with the group design study time at posttest. Second, SCD studies in this area, like those used for this illustration, tend to have at least 10 treatment observations; a single exception in our studies can be seen for John (Delemere &amp; Dounavi, 2018), who has only seven treatment observations. For Model 3, the between-case model specification is: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.2} \\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + u_{0j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.3} \\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.4} \\beta_{2j} = \\gamma_{20} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\gamma_{00}\\) is the across- case average baseline mean and \\(u_{0j}\\) is a case-specific error, which accounts for variation between cases in their mean baseline levels and is assumes assumed to follow a normal distribution with variance \\(\\sigma_{u_0}^2\\). We assume the same average treatment effect (\\(\\gamma_{10}\\)) and the average slope for the treatment phase (\\(\\gamma_{20}\\)) across cases. Thus, there are no error terms in the latter two equations. We show the design-comparable effect size in Equation (4.5), defined as the average raw score treatment effect (\\(\\gamma_{10}\\)) divided by a standard deviation (SD) comparable to the SD used in group design studies. \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.5} \\delta = \\frac{\\gamma_{10}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{u_0}^2 + \\sigma_e^2}}, \\end{equation}\\] Model 4 is specified in a very similar way as Model 3, apart from adding error terms (\\(u_{1j}\\) and \\(u_{2j}\\)) to the final two equations to account for between-case variation in the treatment effect and treatment phase slopes. More specifically: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.6} Y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}Tx_{ij} + \\beta_{2j}Tx_{ij}\\times(Time_{ij}-k_j-D) + e_{ij}, &lt;!-- MC: I use Tx instead of Txt and use e_{ij} instead of r_{ij} in Equation 4.6 in the word doc.--&gt; \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.7} \\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + u_{0j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.8} \\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} + u_{1j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{4.9} \\beta_{2j} = \\gamma_{20} + u_{2j} \\end{equation}\\] Again, the across-case average baseline mean is \\(\\gamma_{00}\\) and the average raw score treatment effect at the focal time is \\(\\gamma_{10}\\). The case-specific errors (\\(u_{0j}, u_{1j}, u_{2j}\\)), which account for between-case differences in baseline level and response to treatment, are assumed multivariate normal with covariance \\(\\Sigma_u = \\begin{bmatrix} \\sigma_{u_0}^2 &amp; &amp; \\\\ \\sigma_{u_1u_0} &amp; \\sigma_{u_1}^2 &amp; \\\\ \\sigma_{u_2u_0} &amp; \\sigma_{u_2u_1} &amp; \\sigma_{u_2}^2\\\\ \\end{bmatrix}\\). Note that one could opt for a model that is intermediate between Model 3 and Model 4, by including only \\(u_{1j}\\) or \\(u_{2j}\\), and thereby allowing random variation in either (but not both) the level or slope changes. We proceed with random variability in each, because we think the treatment could lead to both different shifts in level and different treatment phase slopes for different participants. However, the inclusion of three random effects with an unstructured covariance matrix can be challenging to estimate with a limited number of cases. A simpler model with fewer random effects may be preferable if estimation difficulties arise. Regardless of whether we allow both \\(\\beta_{1j}\\) and \\(\\beta_{2j}\\) to vary randomly as shown in Equations (4.8) and (4.9) or allow only one of these effects to vary randomly, we define the design-comparable effect size exactly as in Equation (4.5). This is because the effect size is scaled by the SD of the outcome in the absence of intervention (i.e., during baseline); it is not impacted by assumptions about the between-case variation during the treatment phase. In the following sections, we will illustrate the estimation of design-comparable effect sizes for the SCD studies using Model 4 based on a priori considerations and the differences noted between cases in their treatment phase slopes. After obtaining the design-comparable effect sizes using Model 4, we repeat the process using Model 3 for several reasons. First, contrasting the models allows us an additional way to examine the empirical support for our chosen model. For instance, visual analyses of the model-implied individual trajectories for Model 4 might show a better fit than those for Model 3. Second, the contrast allows us to examine the sensitivity of the effect size estimates to our selected model. For instance, whether we assume the effect size varies across cases could have little to no effect on the design-comparable effect size estimate. Last, the contrast between Model 3 and Model 4 design-comparable effect sizes allows us to illustrate a method of selecting between models in circumstances where a priori information is not sufficient to select a model. 4.3 Estimating the Design-Comparable Effect Size for the Single-Case Studies 4.3.1 Example 1: Multiple Baselise Study by Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) We can estimate design-comparable effect sizes for any model in Figure 2.4 using a web-based calculator for design-comparable effect sizes (Pustejovsky et al., 2021). The scdhlm app is available at https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/scdhlm/. To use this app, researchers must store the data in an Excel file (.xlsx), comma delimited file (.csv), or text file (.txt). In addition, the data must include columns for the case identifier, +phase identifier_, session number, and outcome. Although not required, we suggest that researchers arrange their data columns by order of variable appearance in the scdhlm app, putting the case identifier in the first column, phase identifier in the second column and so on. We present this layout in Figure 4.5, representing data extracted for the study by Gunning &amp; Espie (2003). In this illustration, for phase identifier, we use b to indicate baseline observations and i to indicate intervention observations. However, researchers can use any other labeling scheme that clearly distinguishes between baseline and intervention conditions (e.g., 0 and 1, respectively). Unlike the phase identifier variable, session number and outcome variables must contain numerical values. We also recommend entering data into the spreadsheet first by case (e.g., enter all the rows of data for the first case before any of the rows of data for the second case), then by session number. Figure 4.5: Snapshot of Spreadsheet Containing Extracted Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) Data After starting the app, we use the Load tab to load the data file, as illustrated in Figure 4.6. The data file could be a .txt or .csv file that includes one dataset or could be an Excel (.xlsx) file that has either one spreadsheet (e.g., a data set for one study), or multiple spreadsheets (one spreadsheet for each of several studies). If using a .xlsx file with multiple spreadsheets, we can select the spreadsheet containing the data for the study of interest from the Load tab. Then, we use the drop-down menus on the right of the screen to indicate the study design (Treatment Reversal versus Multiple Baseline/Multiple Probe across participants) and define which variables in the data set correspond to the case identifier, phase identifier, session, and outcome (see Figure 4.6). Figure 4.6: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Load Tab for Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) After we load our data, we use the Inspect tab to ensure that the raw data imported correctly and mapped to their corresponding variable names (Figure 4.7). In addition, we can use the Inspect tab to view a graph of the data (Figure 4.8). At this point, we recommend that researchers compare these data with the graphed data from the original studies as an additional measure that ensures the study data uploaded to the app correctly (according to the selections on the Load tab). Later, these graphed data can also be checked again for consistency with the tentatively selected model for estimating the design-comparable effect size. Figure 4.7: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Data Tab within the Inspect Tab for Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) Figure 4.8: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Graph Display within the Inspect Tab for Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) Upon completion of data inspection, we next specify the model for the design-comparable effect size using the Model tab. Figure 4.9 shows the specification for Model 4, the model that assumes no baseline trend, a trend in the treatment phase, and an effect that varies across cases. Specification begins with the Baseline phase section, where we select level under Type of time trend because we assume that there are no time trends in the baseline phases. We then choose to include level as a fixed effect, enabling the model to estimate the average baseline level. We also include level as a random effect so that the baseline level can vary from case to case. Next, we specify the model for the Treatment phase. In Type of time trend, we choose the option change in linear trend because Models 3 and 4 allow for possible time trends in only the treatment phases, implying that the trend changes across phases. To specify Model 4, we include both change in level and change in linear trend as fixed effects, so that the average trajectory across cases can reflect both an immediate change in level plus a change in the trend. We also select the option to include change in level as a random effect to allow the shift in level (i.e., treatment effect) to vary across cases. In addition, we opt to allow the change in linear trend to vary from case to case by including it as a random effect. At this point, we have specified the model for the design-comparable effect size that matches Model 4. Note the app allows us to make different potential assumptions about the correlation structure of the session-level errors. Shown are the default options of autoregressive and constant variance across phases. These defaults match the model presented in Equations (4.1) and (4.6) and are used because they seem appropriate for this data set. Also note that at the bottom of the screen (see Figure 4.9), the scdhlm app provides a graph of the data with trend lines that are based on the specified model (Figure 4.9). We recommend that researchers inspect this graph to ensure that the trend lines fit the data reasonably well. If they do not, it raises questions about the model choice. Figure 4.9: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model 4 Specification for Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) For this data set, the a priori identified model provides trajectories that fit the data reasonably well, and thus we proceed to the Effect size tab (Figure 4.10). There are two sliders in the Hypothetical experimental parameters section above the effect size estimates output: Initial treatment time and Follow-up time. The numbers on each slider refer to the sessions or time points in the data series. Although the app populates times automatically, researchers can manipulate them manually to obtain an effect size estimate at a desired point in time. For models with trends in the baseline phase, it matters where we set the initial time. However, for models without baseline trends, only the distance between the two slider values matters. We imagine a relatively typical SCD study with a baseline of 5; therefore, we use the sliding scale to set the Initial treatment time for the Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) study to 5 to represent the last session before initiation of the treatment. Next, we estimate the treatment effect 10 observations into treatment and move the Follow-up time slider to the 15th observation. Given these Model 4 specifications for Gunning &amp; Espie (2003), we find that the estimated between-case standardized mean difference 10 observations into treatment is -1.12 with a standard error (SE) of 0.34 and \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval (CI) [-1.80, -0.45]. Figure 4.10: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Effect size Tab Showing Model 4 Estimate for Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) Now, if we lacked confidence in the a priori decision to select Model 4 and wanted to explore the Model 3 fit, we can re-run the study data without returning to the Load tab. Instead, we go directly to the Model tab to change our specification. To obtain Model 3, we remove (uncheck) change in level and change in linear trend as random effects, constraining the change in level and change in trend from baseline to treatment to be the same for each case. For Model 3, the estimated effect size is -1.10 with an SE of 0.17 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [-1.43, -0.76]. In this case, for the Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) study, the effect size estimates for both Models are similar. However, with the more restrictive assumptions of Model 3, the CI is narrower. If we had used a model that allowed a change in level to vary randomly, but required a fixed slope change, the estimated effect size would be -1.07 with an SE of 0.28 and 95% CI [-1.63, -0.51]. The Effect size tab (Figure 4.10) reports additional information including estimates of other model quantities, information about the model specification, and assumptions used in calculating the design-comparable effect size. The reported degrees of freedom are used by the app in making a small-sample correction to the effect size estimate, analogous to the Hedges’ g correction used with group designs (Hedges, 1981). Larger estimated degrees of freedom mean that the denominator of the design-comparable effect size is more precisely estimated, and that the small-sample correction is less consequential. Conversely, small degrees of freedom indicates that the denominator of the effect size is imprecisely estimated, making the small-sample correction more consequential. The reported autocorrelation is the estimate of the correlation between errors at the first level of the model for the same case that differ by one time-point (or session), based on a first-order autoregressive model. The reported intra-class correlation is an estimate of the between-case variance of the outcome as a proportion of the total variation in the outcome (including both between-case and within-case variance) as of the selected Follow-up time. Larger values of the intra-class correlation indicate that more of the variation in the outcome is between participants. The remaining information in the output (Study design, Estimation method, Baseline specification, Treatment specification, Initial treatment time, Follow-up time) describe the model specification and assumptions used in the effect size calculations. The app includes it to allow for reproducibility of the calculations. 4.3.2 Example 2: Multiple Baseline Study by Delemere &amp; Dounavi (2018) After obtaining a design-comparable effect size for the first SCD (Gunning &amp; Espie, 2003), we repeat these steps for all other included SCD studies. In our second included SCD study (Delemere &amp; Dounavi, 2018), the researchers analyzed two interventions. While we could estimate a separate design-comparable effect size for each, for the purposes of illustrating the computational steps in this chapter, we have pooled the data from the six cases to estimate one design-comparable effect size. To obtain a design-comparable effect size for the Delemere &amp; Dounavi (2018) study, we follow the same sequence of steps: 1. Load the data. 2. Inspect the data in both tabular and graphic form. 3. Specify our selected model for the data (see Figure 4.11 for Model 4). 4. Estimate the design-comparable effect size. Figure 4.11: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model 4 Specification for Delemere and Dounavi (2018) Proceeding with Model 4, we use the Effect size tab of the scdhlm app to obtain a design-comparable effect size for the Delemere &amp; Dounavi (2018) study. As with the previous example, the effect size will depend on the time into intervention at which we estimate the effect size the focal time (indicated by the scdhlm app variable named Follow-up time). When estimating design-comparable effect sizes for SCD studies, researchers should hold the Follow-up time constant across studies. Therefore, we use the Initial treatment time and Follow-up time sliders at the top of the screen to obtain an estimate of effect 10 observations into treatment (i.e., we set the Initial and Follow-up time sliders to five and 15, respectively). The resulting design-comparable effect size for the Delemere &amp; Dounavi (2018) study is -0.70 with an SE of 0.33 and 95% CI [-1.49, 0.09]. Again, if we want to compare these results to those estimated using Model 3, we can go back to the Model tab to change our specification. To obtain Model 3, we remove (uncheck) change in level and change in linear trend as random effects to obtain the same change in level and change in trend from baseline to treatment across cases. We keep all other modeling options the same (e.g., Initial treatment time and Follow-up time). Figure 4.12 shows the Model 3 specification for the Delemere &amp; Dounavi (2018) study. The estimated design-comparable effect size is -0.91 with an SE of 0.28 and 95% CI [-1.52, -0.29]. Comparing the fit of the trend lines obtained from Model 4 (Figure 4.11) to those from Model 3 (Figure 4.12), our originally specified Model 4 appears to provide a better fit for the primary study data. Because of this and because Model 4 is more consistent with both our a priori expectations and the data from our other SCD study (i.e., Gunning &amp; Espie, 2003), it seems reasonable to proceed with the effect estimate from Model 4 (i.e., -0.70). Figure 4.12: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model 3 Specification for Delemere and Dounavi (2018) 4.4 Estimating the Design-Comparable Effect Size for the Group Studies After estimating the design-comparable effect size for the included SCD studies, the next step is to estimate a design-comparable effect size for the included group design study. Details on estimating standardized mean difference effect sizes from group studies are readily available from a variety of sources, including Chapter 12 of The Handbook on Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Borenstein, 2019), books (e.g., Borenstein et al., 2021) and journal articles (e.g., Hedges, 1981, 2007). Therefore, we do not demonstrate the step-by-step effect size estimation methods for group design studies in this methods guide. Instead, we summarize the results below. The included group design study, Montgomery (2004), reported a randomized trial comparing the efficacy of sleep interventions versus a wait-list control condition for families with children with severe learning disabilities. The researchers assigned participating families to a conventional face-to-face intervention (\\(n = 20\\)), a brief treatment delivered as a booklet (\\(n = 22\\)), or a wait-list control condition (\\(n = 24\\)). At posttest, the researchers compared participants’ composite sleep disturbance score (derived from parent reports) across groups, with higher scores corresponding to more severe sleep disturbance. For purposes of effect size calculations, we pooled the results from the face-to-face and booklet intervention conditions. Based on the post-treatment means and standard deviations (Montgomery, 2004, Table 1), the standardized mean difference in sleep onset at the end of intervention was -1.52, with an SE of 0.29. This effect size estimate is based on Hedges’ g, which corrects for small sample size bias. 4.5 Analyzing the Effect Sizes As a final step, we synthesize the effect sizes across both SCD and group design studies. A variety of tools and approaches are available to researchers depending on the goals of their synthesis. For example, researchers can: (a) create graphical displays that show the effect size for each study along with its CI, (b) report an overall average effect size and CI by averaging effect sizes across studies and, (c) examine the extent of effect size variation across studies, (d) explore potential moderators of the effects, and (e) examine the effect sizes for evidence of publication bias. Because the use of design-comparable effect size for the SCD studies produces effect estimates that are like the commonly used standardized mean difference effect sizes from group studies, researchers can accomplish these goals using the methods already established for group design studies. Details on these methods are readily available elsewhere (e.g., Borenstein et al., 2021; H. Cooper et al., 2019). We illustrate the averaging of the effect sizes from our studies here using a fixed effect meta-analysis, consistent with the approach used in What Works Clearinghouse intervention reports (What Works Clearinghouse, 2020b). Table 4.1 reports the effect size estimates, SEs, and fixed effect meta-analysis calculations for the example studies. The top panel uses the design-comparable effect size results for SCD studies based on Model 4. As a sensitivity analysis, the bottom panel presents the results based on Model 3. Note that the effect size estimate from the group design study is the same in both panels. In fixed effect meta-analysis, the overall average effect size estimate is a weighted average of the effect size estimates from the individual studies, with weights proportional to the inverse of the sampling variance (squared SE) of each effect size estimate. Further, the SE of the overall effect size is the square root of the inverse of the total weight. Column C of Table 4.1 reports the inverse-variance weight assigned to each of the studies, with the percentage of the total weight listed in parentheses. In the top panel based on Model 4, the effect size estimate from the group design study receives \\(40\\%\\) of the total weight, while the effect size estimates from the SCD studies receive \\(29\\%\\) and \\(31\\%\\) of the total weight, respectively. The total inverse variance weight is 29.72. The overall average effect size estimate based on Model 4 is -1.15 with an SE of 0.182 and an approximate 95% CI [-1.51, -0.79]. The Q-test for heterogeneity is not significant, \\(Q(2) = 3.50\\), \\(p = .174\\), indicating that the included effect size estimates are consistent with the possibility that all studies were estimating a common effect size parameter. Interestingly, in this example, the effect size estimate from the group design is larger in magnitude than the effect size estimates from the SCD studies. Table 4.1: Fixed Effect Meta-Analysis Calculations for Example Sleep Intervention Studies Study Effect Size Estimate (A) Standard Error (B) Inverse-variance Weight (%) (C) Model 4 Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) -1.12 0.34 8.65 (29.1) Delemere &amp; Dounavi (2018) -0.70 0.33 9.18 (30.9) Montgomery et al. (2004) -1.52 0.29 11.89 (40.0) Fixed effect meta-analysis -1.15 0.18 29.72 (100) Model 3 Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) -1.10 0.17 34.60 (58.4) Delemere &amp; Dounavi (2018) -0.91 0.28 12.76 (21.5) Montgomery et al. (2004) -1.52 0.29 11.89 (20.1) Fixed effect meta-analysis -1.14 0.13 59.25 (100) The bottom panel of Table 4.1 reports the same calculations but using the design-comparable effect size estimates based on Model 3 for the two SCD studies. The most notable difference is that Model 3 more precisely estimates the design-comparable effect size for the Gunning &amp; Espie (2003), resulting in more weight (\\(58\\%\\)) assigned in the fixed effect meta-analysis. For Model 3, the overall average effect size is nearly identical to that obtained for Model 4 (-1.14), but the substantially smaller Model 3 design-comparable effect size for the Gunning &amp; Espie (2003) study results in an SE of 0.13 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [-1.40, -0.89]. In fixed effect meta-analysis, the overall average effect size estimate is a summary of the effect size estimates across the included studies, which are treated as fixed. Therefore, the SE and CI in fixed effect meta-analysis take into account the uncertainty in the process of estimating the effect sizes in each of the individual studies, but they do not account for uncertainty in the process of identifying studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis (Konstantopoulos &amp; Hedges, 2019; Rice et al., 2018). Consequently, they do not provide a basis for generalization beyond the included studies. When conducting syntheses of larger bodies of literature—and especially of studies with heterogeneous populations, design features, or dependent effect sizes—researchers will often prefer to use random effects models (Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998) or their further extensions (Pustejovsky &amp; Tipton, 2021; Van den Noortgate et al., 2013).

We demonstrate the calculations using data from a multiple probe study, a multiple baseline study, and a group study. For the single-case studies, we provide step-by-step instructions for selecting design-comparable effect sizes and estimating them using the scdhlm app. We also discuss estimating the effect size for the group study and synthesizing the effect sizes across the group and single-case studies. In this chapter, we describe how researchers can compute design-comparable effect sizes and synthesize results using models that assume baseline time trends and a treatment effect that has an immediate impact on the level of the outcome, along with an effect on the trend—assumptions that correspond to Models 5 and 6 from Figure 2.4. For illustrative purposes, we calculate effect sizes and synthesize findings from three studies of interventions designed to improve writing skills for students with learning disabilities, including a multiple probe study, a multiple baseline study, and a group design study. The multiple probe study by Datchuk (2016) investigated intervention effects on the writing behavior of four adolescents with writing difficulties. The multiple baseline study by Rodgers et al. (2021) investigated the effects of a writing intervention for four postsecondary students with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Finally, the group study by Hebert et al. (2018) investigated the effects of a writing intervention for 61 fourth and fifth grade students designated as struggling readers (i.e., at least one grade level behind their peers). For this hypothetical synthesis, we choose to use a design-comparable effect size to aggregate effects across these study designs. We organize the procedures into four stages: (1) selecting a design-comparable effect size for the SCD studies, (2) estimating the design-comparable effect size using the scdhlm application, a web-based calculator for design-comparable effect sizes (Pustejovsky et al., 2021), (3) estimating the effect size for the group study, and (4) synthesizing the effect sizes across the SCD and group studies. Because well-developed effect size estimation methods for group studies are illustrated elsewhere (Borenstein et al., 2021; H. Cooper et al., 2019), we concentrate primarily on the first two steps. 5.1 Selecting a Design-Comparable Effect Size for the Single-Case Studies We use the decision rules in Figure 2.4 to select an appropriate design-comparable effect size for the SCD studies. To do this, we consider the characteristics of the population, the context, and the outcome of interest. We make predictions about the type of trends we expect to see in the baseline and treatment phases, and we reflect on the rationale for our expectations. Based on our prior research and experience with this population, we hypothesize that the outcome variable of student writing quality may have baseline phase trends. For example, some students may show slight positive trends because of practice effects, others may show a deteriorating trend in absence of writing feedback, or students’ baseline observations may portray little to no trend at all in absence of intervention. Despite expected variability in the baseline phase, we do expect a noticeable positive shift in the level of responding early in the treatment phase, followed by a gradual increase in writing quality over time. Because we are assuming the presence of trends in both baseline and treatment phases, we tentatively consider Model 5 or Model 6 (see Figure 2.4) to estimate the included study effect sizes. We make the choice between Model 5 and Model 6 based on our logic model and a priori expectation that the treatment effect will not vary across cases (Model 5) or that the treatment effect could vary across cases (Model 6). Based on the different writing abilities of the participants, as well as their unique learning histories and abilities, we anticipate some across-case variation in effects. Thus, we tentatively choose Model 6 as most consistent with our understanding of this context. Next, we visually analyze the graphs from the SCD studies to see if our initial assumptions are reasonable considering the data. Figure 5.1 shows the data we extracted from Datchuk (2016), and Figure 5.2 shows the data we extracted from Rodgers et al. (2021). In viewing the graphs, we examine the extent to which the data are reasonably consistent with the homogeneity and normality assumptions underlying the models for design-comparable effect sizes. Note that in Figures 5.1 and 5.2, we see similar between-case variation and similar variation across phases within a case and can conclude that our homogeneity assumptions are reasonable. In addition, we do not detect the presence of outlying values or clear departures from normality. Consequently, our initial decision to use design-comparable effect sizes appears to be a reasonable choice. During visual analysis of the primary study graphs, we now need to determine the appropriateness of choosing a model with baseline trends. Consistent with our expectations, the typical baseline pattern across cases in Figures 5.1 and 5.2 does exhibit a trend. For example, Richard and Danyell (Figure 5.1) and all cases in Figure 5.1 (except Denny) appear to have a decline in writing skills performance in baseline, as indicated by a downward trend in the data. However, the baseline trends for Nathan and Kendrick (Figure 5.1) are less clear or appear to be increasing (e.g., Denny in Figure 5.2). Because the typical pattern across the two SCD studies is consistent with our trend expectations, we proceed with an assumption of baseline trends. Next, we conduct a similar visual analysis of the treatment phases. For most of the cases, we see an immediate shift in performance along with a change in the trend. Richard, Danyell, and Kendrick (Figure 5.1) show an improvement in writing skills that generally increases over time in treatment (i.e., positive trend lines). Brett, Steve, and Denny (Figure 5.2) show a similar pattern of increasing improvement in writing skills. Because the design-comparable effect size assumes a common model across cases and estimates an average effect across the cases, we find it best to select a model that is consistent with the typical and expected pattern. Thus, it appears reasonable to proceed with a model that assumes a trend in baseline and a different trend in the treatment phases (i.e., Model 5 or Model 6 from Figure 2.4). Figure 5.1: Multiple Probe Data Extracted from Datchuk (2016) Figure 5.2: Multiple Baseline Data Extracted from Rodgers et al. (2021) 5.2 Details of the Models for Design-Comparable Effect Sizes To differentiate between Model 5 and Model 6, we provide a formal specification of each. For both Model 5 and Model 6, we write the within-case (level-1) model as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.1} Y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}Tx_{ij} + \\beta_{2j} (Time_{ij}-B)+ \\beta_{3j}Tx_{ij}\\times((Time_{ij}-k_j)-(B-A)) + e_{ij}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Y_{ij}\\) is the score on the outcome variable \\(Y\\) at measurement occasion \\(i\\) for case \\(j\\), \\(Tx_{ij}\\) is dummy coded with a value of 0 for baseline observations and a value of 1 for the treatment observations, \\(Time_{ij}\\) is the time-point for measurement occasion \\(i\\) for case \\(j\\), \\(B\\) is a centering constant that defines the focal follow up time for defining the effect size, \\(k_j\\) is the last time-point before case \\(j\\) begins their treatment phase, and \\(B-A\\) corresponds to the treatment duration (i.e., the number of time points the case has been in intervention at the focal time). \\(\\beta_{1j}\\) indexes the raw score treatment effect for case \\(j\\), which is the distance between the treatment phase trend line and the extended baseline phase trend line at the focal follow-up time. In addition, this model includes \\(\\beta_{0j}\\), which corresponds to the expected baseline value for case \\(j\\) at the focal follow up time \\(B\\), \\(\\beta_{2j}\\) is the slope of the baseline phase, and \\(\\beta_{3j}\\) is the change in slope that occurs with intervention (i.e., the difference between the treatment and baseline phase slopes for case \\(j\\)). Finally, the error (\\(e_{ij}\\)) is time- and case-specific, assumed to be normally distributed, and first-order autoregressive with variance \\(\\sigma_e^2\\). Figure 5.3: Illustration of Treatment Effect 5 Observations into Treatment for Danyell (Datchuk, 2016) As shown in Figure 5.3, the size of the raw score treatment effect depends on its measurement time (i.e., the raw score effect size depends on the focal time selected). It becomes important for researchers to determine the time at which the effect should be estimated because: (a) the raw score effect size varies over time in the treatment phase, and (b) it is estimated specifically after a specific treatment duration [i.e., when \\((Time_{ij}-k_j)-(B-A)=0\\)]. To choose a focal time, we find it helpful to review the SCD research literature and examine the treatment phase lengths of the extant studies. It is also helpful to consider the duration of the treatment in the group design studies, because such studies typically index the treatment effect immediately after completing the intervention. Generally, We we do not want to avoid extrapolate extrapolating much beyond the length of the actual treatment for most cases. For this illustration we choose to estimate the effect 12 observations into treatment because the group design study (Hebert et al., 2018) had 12 intervention sessions. Further, the SCD studies in this area—particularly the two we are using in this chapter—tend to have at least 12 treatment observations (with the exception of Denny in Figure 5.2, who has 10 treatment observations). For Model 5, we write the between-case model as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.2} \\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + u_{0j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.3} \\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.4} \\beta_{2j} = \\gamma_{20} + u_{2j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.5} \\beta_{3j} = \\gamma_{30} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\gamma_{00}\\) is the across-case average value of the outcome at time zero (0) based on a linear projection of the average baseline trajectory to the focal follow-up time \\(B\\) and \\(u_{0j}\\) is a case-specific error, which accounts for variation between cases in their expected baseline levels at time point \\(B\\). Thus, \\(\\sigma_{u_0}^2\\) corresponds to the projected between-case variance at the focal time if the cases remained in baseline. The across-case average baseline slope is \\(\\gamma_{20}\\), and the corresponding error term (\\(u_{2j}\\)) allows this slope to vary across cases. We assume that the errors in these equations (\\(u_{0j}\\) and \\(u_{2j}\\))) are distributed multivariate normal with covariance \\(\\Sigma_u\\). The across-case average raw score treatment effect at the focal time is \\(\\gamma_{10}\\) and the across-case average change in slope with intervention is \\(\\gamma_{30}\\). We assume these effects to be the same for each case in Model 5, so we do not include error terms in Equations (5.3) and (5.5). We define the design-comparable effect size at the focal time as the raw score treatment effect at the focal time \\(\\gamma_{10}\\) divided by a standard deviation (SD) that is comparable to the SD used to standardize mean differences in the group design studies. Compared to the models discussed in previous chapters, the added complexity of Models 5 and 6 makes researchers’ choice of time points more consequential. Specifically, when we assume that the baseline slopes vary, we assume that the between-case variability changes with time. Thus, the design-comparable effect size will depend on both the duration of the treatment and the projected baseline between-case variability at the follow-up time. It may also be helpful to acknowledge the assumed heterogeneity across time in the SCD studies and to consider a sensitivity analysis that would examines the extent to which the design-comparable effect size depends on the between-case variance estimation time point. The assumed heterogeneity poses a lesser threat for the synthesis if there is little variation between the design-comparable effect size and the different choices for when to estimate the between-case variance. lead to relatively little variation in the design-comparable effect size estimate. With these caveats in mind, and using the model specification given in Equations (5.1)-(5.5), we define the design-comparable effect size as: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.6} \\delta = \\frac{\\gamma_{10}}{\\sqrt{\\sigma_{u_0}^2 + \\sigma_e^2}}, \\end{equation}\\] where \\(\\sigma_{u_0}^2\\) corresponds to the between-case-variance in expected baseline levels at the target time \\(B\\). The numerator of the effect size corresponds to the average effect of receiving treatment for duration \\(B-A\\), where both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are constants specified by the meta-analyst. Therefore, one can interpret this effect size as describing the effect in a hypothetical study where all cases start intervention after time \\(A\\) and where outcomes are assessed at the focal follow-up time \\(B\\) (see Pustejovsky et al., 2014 for more details on this interpretation). The specification of Model 6 is like Model 5, but we add error terms (\\(u_{1j}\\) and \\(u_{3j}\\)) to the equations to account for between-case variation in the treatment effect and between-case variation in the change in slopes with intervention. More specifically: \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.7} Y_{ij} = \\beta_{0j} + \\beta_{1j}Tx_{ij} + \\beta_{2j} (Time_{ij}-B)+ \\beta_{3j}Tx_{ij}\\times((Time_{ij}-k_j)-(B-A)) + e_{ij} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.8} \\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + u_{0j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.9} \\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} + u_{1j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.10} \\beta_{2j} = \\gamma_{20} + u_{2j} \\end{equation}\\] \\[\\begin{equation} \\tag{5.11} \\beta_{3j} = \\gamma_{30} + u_{3j} \\end{equation}\\] The added error terms contribute to variability under the intervention condition. However, because the SD used to standardize the design-comparable effect size is based on the variability in the absence of intervention, the definition of the design-comparable effect size for the Model 6 definition matches that of for Model 5. Like Model 5, the choice of the focal time will impact the design-comparable effect size, not only because it impacts influences the raw score treatment effect \\(\\gamma_{10}\\), but also because it impacts influences the between-case variance. For the purposes of this chapter, we tentatively select Model 6 based on our a priori considerations and illustrate the estimation of design-comparable effect sizes for these data. We also provide a contrast of Model 6 results compared to Model 5 specifications. This contrast is useful for several reasons, including that it provides an additional way for us to examine the empirical support for the model we have chosen (e.g., visual analyses of the implied trajectories for Model 6 may fit the raw data better than those for Model 5). In addition, by contrasting the results of both models, we can examine the sensitivity of our effect size estimates to the model chosen (e.g., whether we assume the effect size varies across cases may have little to no effect on the design-comparable effect size). Finally, contrasting model results allows us to illustrate a method of selecting between models in circumstances where a priori information is not sufficient to inform the choice between specifications. Before illustrating the estimation of the design-comparable effect size for our SCD studies, we emphasize that there are other variations of these models with slopes in both baseline and treatment phases. For example, if we remove the error term from Equation (5.4) or Equation (5.10), we constrain the model so that all cases have the same baseline slope. Constraining the slopes to be equal across cases makes the between-case variance homogeneous across time, which simplifies the definition of the design-comparable effect size. We could also consider removing the error term from Equation (5.11), which would constrain the change in slopes to be equal across the cases. Yet another possible variation is to remove the main treatment effect (i.e., remove the term \\(β_1j\\) Tx_ijfrom Equation (5.1) or Equation (5.7)). In the latter example, by removing the main effect for treatment, we constrain the model so there is no immediate shift in level with intervention, but only a change in the slope of the trend line. For this chapter, we illustrate models that correspond to either assuming the effect of the treatment is constant across cases (Model 5) or the that the treatment effect can vary across cases in trajectories’ magnitudes of level and slope change (Model 6). 5.3 Estimating the Design-Comparable Effect Size for the Single-Case Studies 5.3.1 Example 1: Multiple Probe Study by @Datchuk (2016) We can estimate a design-comparable effect size for Models 5 or 6, as well as the other models suggested in Figure 2.4, using a web-based calculator for design-comparable effect sizes (Pustejovsky et al., 2021), which is available at https://jepusto.shinyapps.io/scdhlm. In using this application, we recommend that researchers have a data file that aligns with the format expected by the application, as shown in Figure 5.5 for the SCD study by Datchuk (2016). To use this app, the data file must be saved as an Excel file (.xlsx), comma delimited file (.csv), or text file (.txt). In addition, the data must include columns for the case identifier, phase identifier, session number, and outcome. We illustrate this arrangement in Figure 5.4 for the Datchuk (2016) study. For the phase identifier, we have used “baseline” to indicate baseline observations and “treatment” to indicate intervention observations. Researchers can also elect to use another labeling scheme if it clearly distinguishes between baseline and intervention conditions (e.g., 0 to indicate baseline observations and 1 to indicate intervention observations). Although the data format for the phase identifier variable is flexible (text or numeric), the scdhlm app requires use of only numerical values for the session number and outcome variables. Additionally, we recommend that users arrange their data by first case (i.e., enter all the rows of data for the first case before any of the rows of data for the second case), followed by session number. Figure 5.4: Snapshot of Spreadsheet Containing Extracted Datchuk (2016) Data After starting the app, we use the Load tab to load the data file, as illustrated in Figure 5.5. The data file could be a .txt or .csv file that includes one dataset or could be an .xlsx file that has either one spreadsheet (e.g., a data set for one study), or multiple spreadsheets (one spreadsheet for each of several studies). If using an .xlsx file with multiple spreadsheets, we can select the spreadsheet containing the data for the study of interest from the Load tab. Then, we use the drop-down menus on the right of the screen to indicate the study design (Treatment Reversal or Multiple Baseline/Multiple Probe across participants) and define which variables in the data set correspond to the case identifier, phase identifier, session, and outcome (see Figure 5.5). After loading the data, we use the Inspect tab to ensure that the raw data were imported correctly and mapped to their corresponding variable names (Figure 5.6). In addition, we can use the Inspect tab to view a graph of the data (Figure 5.7). At this point, we recommend that researchers compare these data with the graphed data from the original study to ensure the study data uploaded to the app correctly. Later, we can check these graphed data for consistency with the tentatively selected model for the design-comparable effect size. Figure 5.5: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Load Tab for Datchuk (2016) Figure 5.6: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Data Tab within the Inspect Tab for Datchuk (2016) Figure 5.7: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Graph Display within the Inspect Tab for Datchuk (2016) After data inspection, we go to the Model tab to specify the model for the design-comparable effect size. Figure 5.8 shows the specification for Model 6 (i.e., the model that assumes trends in baseline, different trends in treatment, and an effect that varies across cases). Starting with specification of the Baseline phase, we select linear trend under Type of time trend because we assume the presence of linear time trends in the baseline phases. We then include level and linear trend as fixed effects to enable model estimation for an across-case average linear trend line for the baseline phase. To allow the intercepts of the trend lines to vary from case to case, we select the option to include level as a random effect. We also include linear trend as a random effect to allow the baseline trends to vary across cases. After Baseline phase model specification, we attend to the specification of the Treatment phase. For Type of time trend, we select change in linear trend because we assume trends differ across phases. We then elect to include change in level and change in linear trend as fixed effects to allow the across-case average trend line for the treatment phase to differ from the across-case average baseline phase trend line, in both level and slope. We also check the boxes to include change in level and change in linear trend as random effects to allow the changes in trend lines from baseline to treatment phase to vary across cases. Note the app allows us to make different potential assumptions about the correlation structure of the session-level errors. Shown are the default options of autoregressive and constant variance across phases. These defaults match the model presented in Equations (5.1) and (5.7) and were used because they seem appropriate for this data set. Figure 5.8: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model Tab Showing Model 6 Specification for Datchuk (2016) For this data set, we see that our a priori identified model provides trajectories that fit the data reasonably well. Thus, we proceed to the Effect Size tab, as shown in Figure (fig:Datchuk-2016-ES). On the Effect Size tab screen, there are two sliders—Initial treatment time and Follow-up time. Moving these, we can change the size of the effect size to specify how far into treatment we want to estimate an effect. In our example, we use the default slider value of 9 for the Initial treatment time, which corresponds with the time point after which we would introduce treatment in a hypothetical study (were each case to begin the treatment phase at the same time). Next, because we want to estimate the treatment effect 12 observations into the treatment phase, we set the second slider (Follow-up time) to 21. This number corresponds to the 12th observation of a treatment phase that started immediately after observation 9. Following these specifications, the design-comparable effect size estimate for this study is 1.48, with a standard error (SE) of 0.98, and \\(95\\%\\) confidence interval (CI) [-0.65, 3.62]. Figure 5.9: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Effect size Tab Showing Model 6 Estimate for Datchuk (2016) The additional information reported on the Effect size tab (Figure 5.9) includes estimates of other quantities from the model and information about the model specification and assumptions used in calculating the design-comparable effect size. The reported degrees of freedom are used in making a small-sample correction to the effect size estimate, analogous to the Hedges’ \\(g\\) correction used with group designs (Hedges, 1981). Larger estimated degrees of freedom mean that the denominator of the design-comparable effect size is more precisely estimated, and that the small-sample correction is less consequential. Conversely, small degrees of freedom indicates that the denominator of the effect size is imprecisely estimated, and that the small-sample correction is more consequential. The reported autocorrelation is the estimate of the correlation between errors at the first level of the model for the same case that differ by one time-point (or session), based on a first-order autoregressive model. The reported intra-class correlation is an estimate of the between-case variance of the outcome as a proportion of the total variation in the outcome (including both between-case and within-case variance) as of the selected Follow-up time. Larger values of the intra-class correlation indicate that more of the variation in the outcome is between participants. The remaining information in the output (Study design, Estimation method, Baseline specification, Treatment specification, Initial treatment time, Follow-up time) describes the model specification and assumptions used in the effect size calculations. The app includes this information to allow for reproducibility of the calculations. Having obtained our main design-comparable effect size estimate based on Model 6, we also want to check its sensitivity to our selected time at which we estimate the between-case variability. To do so, we move the sliders on the Effect Size tab so that the Initial treatment time slider is now set to 5, corresponding to the time of the last baseline observation in our hypothetical experiment. We change the Follow-up time to 17, which keeps the duration of the treatment at 12 observations. After making these changes, the design-comparable effect size is an estimated 1.34 with an SE of 0.91 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [-.69, 3.37]. The sensitivity of the design-comparable effect size estimate to our choice of when to estimate the between-case variance demonstrates a potential challenge of using design-comparable effect sizes in contexts where it is assumed that the baseline slopes vary across cases. If our a priori arguments for selecting Model 6 were tenuous, or if some members of our research team thought we should consider Model 5, we can do so by going back to the Model tab and changing our specification. Specifically, under the specification of the Treatment phase, we uncheck the boxes to exclude change in level and change in linear trend as random effects. By removing those two random effects, we constrain the treatment effect to be the same for all cases (i.e., the change in level and change in linear trend is the same for each case). We keep all other modeling options the same as Model 6 (e.g., time sliders). In Figure 5.10, we can see that the simpler, more restrictive Model 5 specification has a slightly less desirable fit for the trend lines than those of Model 6. The estimated design-comparable effect size for Model 5 is 1.41, with an SE of 0.64, and \\(95\\%\\) CI [-0.09, 2.92]. Ultimately, if we had remaining SCD studies to be included in our synthesis, we would hold off selecting between Models 5 and 6 until fit was examined for the data from each of the SCD studies. Figure 5.10: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model 5 Specification for Datchuk (2016) 5.3.2 Example 2: Multiple Baseline Study by Rodgers et al. (2021) After estimating the design-comparable effect size for the first SCD study by Datchuk (2016), we repeat these steps for all remaining single-case studies in our synthesis. For our second SCD study (Rodgers et al., 2021), we run through this same sequence of steps: 1. Load the data. 2. Inspect the data in both tabular and graphic form. 3. Specify our selected model for the data (i.e., Model 6 for this illustration). 4. Estimate the design-comparable effect size. As shown in Figure 5.11, the Model 6 estimated trajectories fit the data reasonably well. After completing step 2, we proceed with use of Model 6 for the Rodgers et al. (2021) dataset (step 3) and then start the process of estimating the design-comparable effect size (step 4). On the Effect Size tab, we need to make choices about the initial treatment time and follow-up time-points. Locating the shortest baseline (Brett), we leave the Initial treatment time slider at the default value of 9—the last baseline observation for Brett. We set the Follow-up time slider to 21, so that the treatment duration for the hypothetical study is 12 and consistent with the time specification for the previous SCD study (Datchuk, 2016). After defining the times, the resulting design-comparable effect size estimate is 0.76 with an SE of 0.74 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [-1.36, 2.88]. Finally, to check the sensitivity of our estimate to our specified times for between-case variability, we change the values of the Initial treatment time and Follow-up time sliders to 5 and 17, respectively. The resulting design-comparable effect size changes to 0.90 with an SE of 0.75 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [-1.06, 2.87]. Figure 5.11: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model 6 Specification for Rodgers (2021) If our a priori arguments for selecting Model 6 were tenuous, or if some members of our research team thought we should consider Model 5, we can do so by going back to the Model tab for each of our SCD studies and changing our specification. Specifically, under the specification of the Treatment phase, we uncheck the boxes where we had previously included random effects for change in level and change in linear trend. By removing those two random effects, we constrain the treatment effect to be the same for all cases (i.e., the change in level and change in linear trend is the same for each case). We keep all other modeling options the same. We show the Model 5 specification for the Rodgers et al. (2021) study in Figure 5.12. With the more restrictive model, the fit of the trend lines is similar but not quite as good compared to those in the originally specified Model 6. For Model 5, the estimated design-comparable effect size is 0.46, with an SE of 0.40 and \\(95\\%\\) CI [-0.39, 1.31]. Across the included SCD studies, if the fit is similar across models or is better for the model selected a priori, then it is preferable for researchers to use the one that best aligns with their logic model. For this illustration, we move forward with the Model 6 estimates because this model is most consistent with our a priori expectations, and the resulting fit is similar to or slightly better than its Model 5 contrast. Figure 5.12: Between-Case Standardized Mean Difference Estimator (scdhlm, v. 0.6.0) Model 5 Specification for Rodgers (2021) 5.4 Estimating the Design-Comparable Effect Size for the Group Study After estimating the design-comparable effect size for each SCD in the synthesis, we estimate the design-comparable effect size for each included group study. Details on estimating standardized mean difference effect sizes from group studies are readily available from a variety of sources, including Chapter 12 of The Handbook on Research Synthesis and Meta-Analysis (Borenstein, 2019), books (e.g., Borenstein et al., 2021) and journal articles (e.g., Hedges, 1981, 2007). We therefore omit the details of the effect size calculations for the group design study in this example. Hebert et al. (2018) reported a randomized-control trial examining the impact of a writing intervention for 51 fourth and fifth grade students. The researchers randomly assigned the students to an informational text writing intervention (\\(n = 32\\)) or to a control group (\\(n = 29\\)), in which students focused on mathematics writing so that the total amount of writing time was controlled. While the Hebert et al. (2018) study included various outcome data, we focus on the proximal measure of student ability to write informational text using simple description. To measure the effect, we calculate Hedges’ \\(g\\), which corrects for small sample size bias, using the adjusted mean difference between groups controlling for the pretest writing assessment and student characteristics. The resulting effect size estimate is 0.62, with an SE of 0.22. 5.5 Analyzing the Effect Sizes As a final step, we synthesize the effect sizes across both the SCD and group design studies. Depending on the researchers’ goals of the synthesis, a variety of options are available: (a) creating graphical displays that show the effect size and CIs for each study, (b) averaging the effect sizes and then creating a CI for the overall average effect, (c) examining the extent of variation in effect sizes across studies, (d) exploring potential moderators of the effect, and (e) examining the effect sizes for evidence of publication bias. Because the use of design-comparable effect size for the single-case studies produces effect size estimates that are in the same metric as the commonly used standardized mean difference effect sizes from group studies, researchers can accomplish these goals using the methods developed for group studies. Details on these methods are readily available elsewhere (e.g., Borenstein et al., 2021; H. Cooper et al., 2019). We illustrate the pooling of the effect sizes from our studies here using a fixed effect meta-analysis, consistent with the approach used in What Works Clearinghouse intervention reports (What Works Clearinghouse, 2020b). Table 5.1 reports the effect size estimates, SEs, and fixed effect meta-analysis calculations for the example studies. The top panel uses the design-comparable effect size results for SCD studies based on Model 6. As a sensitivity analysis, the bottom panel presents the results based on Model 5. Note that the effect size estimate from the group design study is the same in both panels. In fixed effect meta-analysis, the overall average effect size estimate is a weighted average of the individual studies’ effect size estimates, with weights proportional to the inverse of the sampling variance (squared SE) of each effect size estimate. Column C of Table 5.1 reports the inverse variance weight assigned to each of the studies, with the percentage of the total weight listed in parentheses. For the analysis based on Model 6, the effect size estimate from the group design study receives \\(88\\%\\) of the total weight, while the effect size estimates from the single-case studies receive \\(4\\%\\) and \\(8\\%\\) of the total weight, respectively. The total inverse variance weight is 23.5. The overall average effect size estimate is 0.67 with an SE of 0.213 and an approximate \\(95\\%\\) CI [0.26, 1.08]. The Q-test for heterogeneity is not significant, \\(Q(2) = 0.75\\), \\(p = .69\\), indicating that the evidence is consistent with the possibility that all the studies provide estimates of the same true effect size. Table 5.1: Fixed Effect Meta-Analysis Calculations for Example Writing Intervention Studies Study Effect Size Estimate (A) Standard Error (B) Inverse-variance Weight (%) (C) Model 6 Datchuk (2016) 1.48 0.98 1.04 (4.4) Rodgers et al. (2020) 0.76 0.74 1.82 (7.8) Hebert et al. (2018) 0.62 0.22 20.66 (87.8) Fixed effect meta-analysis 0.67 0.21 25.53 (100) Model 5 Datchuk (2016) 1.41 0.46 2.44 (8.3) Rodgers et al. (2020) 0.46 0.40 6.25 (21.3) Hebert et al. (2018) 0.62 0.22 20.66 (70.4) Fixed effect meta-analysis 0.65 0.18 29.35 (100) The bottom panel of Table 5.1 reports the same calculations using the Model 5 design-comparable effect size estimates for the two SCD studies. For both Datchuk (2016) and Rodgers et al. (2021), Model 5 effect sizes appear to be more precisely estimated and therefore receive more weight in the fixed effect meta-analysis (\\(8\\%\\) and \\(21\\%\\), respectively). The overall average effect size based on Model 5 is quite like the average effect size based on Model 6, but is somewhat more precisely estimated, with an SE of 0.18 and a \\(95\\%\\) CI [0.29, 1.01], due to the smaller SEs in the SCD studies. In fixed effect meta-analysis, the overall average effect size estimate is a summary of the effect size estimates across the included studies, which are treated as fixed. The SE and CI in fixed effect meta-analysis consider the uncertainty in the process of estimating the effect size estimates in each of the individual studies. However, they do not provide a basis for generalization beyond the included studies because the fixed meta-analysis does not account for uncertainty in the process of identifying studies for inclusion in the meta-analysis (Konstantopoulos &amp; Hedges, 2019; Rice et al., 2018). When conducting syntheses of larger bodies of literature—and especially of studies with heterogeneous populations, design features, or dependent effect sizes—researchers will often prefer to use random effects models (Hedges &amp; Vevea, 1998) or their further extensions (Pustejovsky &amp; Tipton, 2021; Van den Noortgate et al., 2013).
